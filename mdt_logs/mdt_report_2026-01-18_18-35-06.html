      <h2>Final MDT Output</h2>
      <pre>Final Assessment:
Disseminated metastatic pelvic malignancy with liver, presacral/sacral, mesenteric, rectal, and right iliac bone involvement [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR], severe anemia [@20230103|5600862], but histologic type, primary site, prior treatments, and performance status remain unknown and prevent evidence-based systemic regimen selection.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently obtain and review all surgical/biopsy pathology with IHC; pathologist to issue integrated working diagnosis and origin (currently unknown).  
- Collect complete treatment history, ECOG, symptom burden, and anemia/bleeding workup; arrange transfusion/supportive care to correct Hgb before therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Request somatic tumor NGS including MSI/TMB and formal clarification of ATM p.Y316C classification with genetics lab [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine bone/peritoneal mapping and biopsy targeting, without delaying palliative systemic planning justified by CT/MR [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].  

Change Triggers:
- If pathology and history define primary site and prior lines, then finalize palliative systemic regimen and any symptom-directed local therapies.  
- If ECOG poor, uncontrolled anemia/bleeding, or patient prefers comfort-focused care, then prioritize best supportive care over aggressive systemic treatment.</pre>

    <summary>Initial Expert Opinions (raw)</summary>
    <pre>{
  &quot;chair&quot;: &quot;- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive presacral mass, pelvic peritoneal disease and new multiple liver metastases by Dec 2022 [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  \n- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) and lymphopenia; performance status, symptoms, and bleeding source must be clarified before systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  \n- Tumor markers (very high CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3) support active disease; histologic subtype and prior treatments are unknown [@20221229|9703212].  \n- HRD-negative, BRCA-wild type; only germline ATM variant known, limiting standard maintenance options [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n- Must obtain: pathology report (histology, stage), prior systemic/surgical treatments, ECOG status, current symptoms, renal function trend, and patient goals.&quot;,
  &quot;oncologist&quot;: &quot;- Diagnosis, disease stage, prior systemic therapy line, and treatment intent are all unknown/needs update before regimen decision.  \n\n- Current labs show significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with otherwise adequate neutrophils and platelets for most systemic therapies [@20230103|5600862].  \n\n- Renal and hepatic function appear adequate for standard dosing; mild AST/ALT elevation and normal bilirubin, creatinine, albumin acceptable [@20221229|8300002].  \n\n- Tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, HE4, ROMA) markedly elevated, but primary tumor type and radiologic disease status unknown/needs update [@20221229|9703212].  \n\n- Germline ATM variant with HRD negative and BRCA1/2 wild-type may limit some targeted options; broader somatic profiling and MSI/TMB unknown/needs update [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].&quot;,
  &quot;radiologist&quot;: &quot;- Liver: multiple low-density metastases, increased number and size vs 2022-10-21; largest ~17×14 mm. [@2022-12-29|CT]  \n\n- Liver: multiple non-enhancing cystic lesions, stable, consistent with hepatic cysts. [@2022-12-29|CT]  \n\n- Pelvis: presacral mass 53×44 mm, enlarged, invading adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, post-surgical recurrence pattern. [@2022-12-29|MR]  \n\n- Pelvis: multiple enhancing mesenteric nodules and new right iliac bone lesion, consistent with metastatic spread. [@2022-12-29|MR]  \n\n- Rectum: focal wall thickening with enhancement; needs clinical correlation for obstruction symptoms and endoscopic evaluation. [@2022-12-29|MR]&quot;,
  &quot;pathologist&quot;: &quot;- No histology, grade, or IHC available; primary diagnosis and tumor type cannot be confirmed. Update surgical pathology reports.  \n\n- Germline ATM p.Y316C variant reported; clinical significance (pathogenic vs VUS) not specified. Clarify classification and lab interpretation [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n\n- HRD reported negative; BRCA1/2 and other listed genes show no pathogenic germline variants [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n\n- Somatic/tumor sequencing, MSI/TMB status, and actionable fusions or amplifications are unknown. Obtain comprehensive tumor molecular report if done.  \n\n- Current pathology staging, margins, and involved sites (ovary vs other origin) are undocumented. Upload all prior and latest pathology reports.&quot;,
  &quot;nuclear&quot;: &quot;- No PET/CT is available; whole-body FDG PET/CT is needed to assess metabolic activity of hepatic, pelvic, and bone lesions.  \n\n- Prior CT/MR show multifocal liver lesions and pelvic mass with sacral and iliac bone involvement, highly suspicious for metastases/recurrence [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR; @2022-10-24|CT].  \n\n- PET/CT could upstage disease by confirming extra-pelvic metastases (liver, bone, peritoneal nodules) and defining systemic versus localized recurrence.  \n\n- PET/CT may better delineate sacral, right iliac bone, and rectal involvement for radiotherapy or surgical planning.  \n\n- Need updated PET/CT, current clinical staging, and original pathology/histology report to refine recurrence pattern and staging assessment.&quot;

    Systemic anti-cancer treatment in malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs): current management and promising approaches.
    Malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs) are rare. Unlike epithelial ovarian cancer, MOGCTs typically occur in girls and young women. Fertility-sparing surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy remain the standard of care, providing high chance of cure at all stages. Given the lack of high-quality…

    Significance of platinum distribution to predict platinum resistance in ovarian cancer after platinum treatment in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
    Most patients with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and develop resistance to platinum-based agents. The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spe…

    Overcoming the challenges of drug development in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
    The definition of &quot;platinum-resistant ovarian cancer&quot; has evolved; it now also reflects cancers for which platinum treatment is no longer an option. Standard of care for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is single-agent, non-platinum chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, which produces modest re…

    Targeted therapy and immunotherapy for platinum-refractory advanced ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma: a case report.
    Ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma is an extremely rare type of ovarian histology. Platinum-refractory disease is also uncommon, but can be fatal because of the lack of available treatment options. To date, there is no study or case report on platinum-refractory ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma or its r…

    Histopathologic image-based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.
    Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. The…</pre>

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Systemic anti-cancer treatment in malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs): current management and promising approaches.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs) are rare. Unlike epithelial ovarian cancer, MOGCTs typically occur in girls and young women. Fertility-sparing surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy remain the standard of care, providing high chance of cure at all stages. Given the lack of high-quality studies in this field, current practice guidelines recommend chemotherapy regimens adopted in testicular germ cell tumours. However, platinum-resistant/refractory MOGCTs retain a worse prognosis in comparison with their male counterpart. Herein, we focus on current systemic anti-cancer treatment options in MOGCTs and promising approaches. Future studies enrolling exclusively female participants or germ cell tumour trials allowing participation of MOGCT patients are strongly recommended in order to improve evidence on existing management and develop novel strategies.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Significance of platinum distribution to predict platinum resistance in ovarian cancer after platinum treatment in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Most patients with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and develop resistance to platinum-based agents. The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to visualize the platinum distribution in the ovarian cancer tissues at the time of interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 27patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Two distinct patterns of platinum distribution were observed. Type A (n = 16): platinum accumulation at the adjacent stroma but little in the tumor; type B (n = 11): even distribution of platinum throughout the tumor and adjacent stroma. The type A patients treated post-surgery with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly shorter periods of recurrence after the last platinum-based chemotherapy session (p = 0.020) and were diagnosed with \&quot;platinum-resistant recurrence\&quot;. Moreover, type A was significantly correlated with worse prognosis (p = 0.031). Post-surgery treatment with non-platinum-based chemotherapy could be effective for the patients classified as type A. Our findings indicate that the platinum resistance can be predicted prior to recurrence, based on the platinum distribution; this could contribute to the selection of more appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, which may lead to improves prognoses.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Overcoming the challenges of drug development in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;The definition of \&quot;platinum-resistant ovarian cancer\&quot; has evolved; it now also reflects cancers for which platinum treatment is no longer an option. Standard of care for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is single-agent, non-platinum chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, which produces modest response rates, with the greatest benefits achieved using weekly paclitaxel. Several recent phase 3 trials of pretreated patients with prior bevacizumab exposure failed to meet their primary efficacy endpoints, highlighting the challenge in improving clinical outcomes among these patients. Combination treatment with antiangiogenics has improved outcomes, whereas combination strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors have yielded modest results. Despite extensive translational research, there has been a lack of reliable and established biomarkers that predict treatment response in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Additionally, in the platinum-resistant setting, implications for the time between the penultimate dose of platinum therapy and platinum retreatment remain an area of debate. Addressing the unmet need for an effective treatment in the platinum-resistant setting requires thoughtful clinical trial design based on a growing understanding of the disease. Recent cancer drug approvals highlight the value of incorporating molecular phenotypes to better define patients who are more likely to respond to novel therapies. Clinical trials designed per the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup recommendations-which advocate against relying solely upon the platinum-free interval-will help advance our understanding of recurrent ovarian cancer response where platinum rechallenge in the platinum-resistant setting may be considered. The inclusion of biomarkers in clinical trials will improve patient stratification and potentially demonstrate correlations with biomarker expression and duration of response. With the efficacy of antibody-drug conjugates shown for the treatment of some solid and hematologic cancers, current trials are evaluating the use of various novel conjugates in the setting of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Emerging novel treatments coupled with combination trials and biomarker explorations offer encouraging results for potential strategies to improve response rates and prolong progression-free survival in this population with high unmet need. This review outlines existing data from contemporary clinical trials of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer and suggests historical synthetic benchmarks for non-randomized trials.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Targeted therapy and immunotherapy for platinum-refractory advanced ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma: a case report.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma is an extremely rare type of ovarian histology. Platinum-refractory disease is also uncommon, but can be fatal because of the lack of available treatment options. To date, there is no study or case report on platinum-refractory ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma or its relevant treatment.\n          \nHerein, we report the case of a 38-year-old Chinese woman with platinum-refractory advanced ovarian adenosquamous carcinoma who received clinical benefit from poly adenosine diphosphate ([ADP] ribose) polymerase and programmed death-1 inhibitors after failure of prior multiline chemotherapies and antiangiogenic agents. The targeted therapy and immunotherapy-controlled disease deterioration and improved performance status. Thus far, the patient has survived longer than 15 months, and she is taking nivolumab as maintenance treatment.\n          \nTargeted therapy and immunotherapy may be options for rare categories of ovarian cancer, but this warrants more clinical evidence of efficacy and toxicity.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Histopathologic image-based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image-based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n = 394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n = 284 and n = 136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model&#x27;s decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC.&quot;,

    <pre>- NCCN defines recurrent ovarian cancer platinum sensitivity on a spectrum based on platinum-free interval; treatment selection should use clinical judgment rather than rigid cutoffs, recognizing overlap between “sensitive” and “resistant” categories [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  

- For platinum-resistant disease (including cases where further platinum is not appropriate), standard of care is single-agent non-platinum chemotherapy (e.g., weekly paclitaxel, PLD, topotecan, gemcitabine) with or without bevacizumab; responses are modest and prognosis poor, underscoring need to consider clinical trials when available [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14; @pubmed:37916177].  

- Bevacizumab-containing regimens are guideline-supported in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer for patients without contraindications, improving progression-free survival when added to single-agent chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  

- Re-treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy is generally reserved for platinum-sensitive relapse; NCCN notes limited benefit and increased toxicity from further platinum in clearly platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory disease and recommends non-platinum regimens in that setting [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14–15].  

- Targeted therapy and immunotherapy may be considered in select, heavily pretreated or rare-histology ovarian cancers when actionable molecular alterations or high TMB/MSI-H are present; case-level evidence suggests potential benefit in platinum-refractory settings but data remain sparse and such use is typically in clinical trial or off-label context [@pubmed:29983579].  

- Experimental approaches to predicting platinum resistance (e.g., tissue platinum distribution, deep learning histopathologic classifiers) show promise for stratifying patients before or early in treatment but are not yet standard of care; MDTs should consider these only in research or specialized centers [@pubmed:35296733; @pubmed:38762636].  

- Malignant ovarian germ cell tumors are managed differently from epithelial ovarian cancer: fertility-sparing surgery plus platinum-based chemotherapy yields high cure rates across stages, and treatment should aim to preserve fertility when oncologically safe [@pubmed:33490225].</pre>
