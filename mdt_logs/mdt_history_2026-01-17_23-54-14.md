## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
High-grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma with peritoneal spread post-interval debulking and early adjuvant platinum–taxane, responding biochemically but with staging, residual disease, and thrombosis status still insufficiently defined for maintenance decisions.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Maintain current systemic-therapy trajectory today; do not change regimen until full chemo record, ECOG, and labs are reviewed (all unknown).  
- Urgently obtain operative note and full pathology/IHC/molecular reports to define FIGO stage, primary site, and R0/R1/R2 status (unknown).  
- Arrange contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT or PET/CT with RECIST to assess residual disease and re-evaluate left ovarian vein thrombosis (current imaging date unknown).  
- Clarify anticoagulation use and VTE/bleeding risks; formalize a thrombosis management and imaging follow‑up plan once data are available (unknown).  

Change Triggers:
- If updated imaging or clinical data show progression or intolerance, reassess systemic therapy intent and consider modifying or pausing active treatment.  
- If chemotherapy course, response, and residual burden confirm standard 1L completion and good status, formally discuss and choose maintenance versus surveillance strategy.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Post-NACT interval surgery for high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma; continue adjuvant platinum-taxane to complete standard first-line course if tolerable.  
- Clarify FIGO stage, residual disease status, and completeness of cytoreduction from op note/path report before finalizing adjuvant strategy.  
- Consider maintenance approach post-chemotherapy completion, tailored to BRCA/HRD-negative status and response depth (CA125, imaging).  
- Urgently confirm and manage left ovarian vein thrombosis (anticoagulation plan, duration) and assess bleeding/VTE risk.  
- Update ECOG performance status, current symptoms, full labs (CBC, renal, hepatic) and latest post-op imaging before firm treatment decisions.
```


## oncologist

```
- High-grade serous ovarian cancer, bilateral, post-surgery on 2023-06-21 with adjuvant first-line platinum/taxane ongoing; completion status unclear.  
- CA125 markedly decreased from >1000 to 81.5 by 2023-07-20, suggesting response, but imaging correlation is unknown/needs update.  
- HRD- and BRCA-wildtype germline and somatic; impacts maintenance options and expected benefit from targeted agents.  
- Organ function, ECOG performance, residual disease status (R0/R1/R2), and detailed imaging after surgery are unknown/need update.  
- Clarify chemotherapy plan: intended total cycles, tolerance/toxicities, and whether any maintenance strategy has been started or planned.
```


## radiologist

```
- CT shows adnexal mass with omental/mesenteric nodules and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, compatible with peritoneal metastatic disease [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2023-04-21].  

- Sigmoid colon wall thickening; direct visualization (endoscopy) needed to assess for primary or secondary involvement [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2023-04-21].  

- Postoperative abdominopelvic peritoneal haziness with effusion; differentiate evolving postsurgical change from residual peritoneal disease on follow-up imaging [@IMAGING_STUDIES|Unknown].  

- Left ovarian vein thrombosis present; requires correlation for anticoagulation management and interval imaging to document stability/resolution [@IMAGING_STUDIES|Unknown].  

- No interval or RECIST-style trend data; updated contrast-enhanced CT or MRI needed to assess current disease burden and treatment response.
```


## pathologist

```
- Histology consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma involving bilateral ovaries and multiple peritoneal/serosal sites, post-treatment changes noted [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2023-06-21].  
- Exact primary site (fimbrial tube vs ovarian vs peritoneal) not explicitly assigned; clarification from original full report needed.  
- No formal FIGO stage documented; based on described spread, stage IIIC–IV likely but needs explicit staging confirmation.  
- BRCA1/2 wildtype and HRD-negative status documented; TP53 and PIK3CA mutations reported, but detailed molecular report/date are missing [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2023-06-21].  
- IHC panel (WT1, p53 pattern, ER/PR, PAX8, Ki-67, MMR proteins) not provided; full IHC report needed.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT imaging is available; metabolic disease distribution and intensity are currently unknown/needs update.  

- Prior CT shows adnexal mass with omental/mesenteric nodules and sigmoid thickening, suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis and possible bowel involvement [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|2023-04-21].  

- Postoperative abdominopelvic haziness and effusion may represent postoperative change versus residual peritoneal disease; distinction needs PET/CT correlation [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|Unknown].  

- PET/CT would help differentiate postoperative inflammation from viable tumor and refine staging or recurrence suspicion, especially in peritoneum and bowel.  

- For further opinion, upload most recent PET/CT report and images, plus operative/pathology details and current tumor markers.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:

- Interval debulking on 21/06/2023; completeness of cytoreduction unclear.
- Post-op platinum–taxane started; total cycles/completion and tolerance not documented.
- CA125 dropped from >1000 to 81.5 by 20/07/2023, indicating response; no formal imaging response assessment.
- BRCA1/2 wildtype, HRD-negative; TP53 and PIK3CA mutations reported.
- Imaging shows peritoneal carcinomatosis, retroperitoneal nodes, sigmoid thickening, and postoperative haziness/effusion.
- Left ovarian vein thrombosis present radiologically.

Controversies:
- Uncertain exact FIGO stage and primary site (tube vs ovary vs peritoneum).
- Unknown R0/R1/R2 status and residual disease burden, limiting adjuvant/maintenance planning.
- Unclear current disease extent vs postsurgical change on imaging.
- Best maintenance approach in BRCA/HRD-negative setting (agent vs observation) given efficacy/toxicity balance.

Missing Info:
- Full op note, explicit FIGO stage, and cytoreduction status.
- Recent contrast CT/MRI or PET/CT with RECIST, and follow-up on ovarian vein thrombosis.
- Current ECOG, symptoms, CBC/renal/hepatic/coagulation.
- Detailed chemotherapy record (cycles, dates, dosing, toxicities, completion).
- Full pathology/IHC panel and full molecular report.
- Anticoagulation regimen and VTE/bleeding risk assessment.
- Results of any endoscopic assessment of sigmoid thickening.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review op/path reports for staging and R0/R1/R2 status.
- Clarify and, if feasible, complete standard first-line platinum–taxane course.
- Arrange updated cross-sectional imaging (± PET/CT) for response and residual disease assessment.
- Confirm and manage left ovarian vein thrombosis with defined anticoagulation strategy and imaging follow-up.
- After chemotherapy and response assessment, discuss maintenance vs surveillance appropriate for BRCA/HRD-negative disease.
- Reassess ECOG, labs, and toxicity profile to guide further systemic therapy and anticoagulation decisions.

  **Assistant:** Final Assessment:
High-grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma with peritoneal spread post-interval debulking and early adjuvant platinum–taxane, responding biochemically but with staging, residual disease, and thrombosis status still insufficiently defined for maintenance decisions.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Maintain current systemic-therapy trajectory today; do not change regimen until full chemo record, ECOG, and labs are reviewed (all unknown).  
- Urgently obtain operative note and full pathology/IHC/molecular reports to define FIGO stage, primary site, and R0/R1/R2 status (unknown).  
- Arrange contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT or PET/CT with RECIST to assess residual disease and re-evaluate left ovarian vein thrombosis (current imaging date unknown).  
- Clarify anticoagulation use and VTE/bleeding risks; formalize a thrombosis management and imaging follow‑up plan once data are available (unknown).  

Change Triggers:
- If updated imaging or clinical data show progression or intolerance, reassess systemic therapy intent and consider modifying or pausing active treatment.  
- If chemotherapy course, response, and residual burden confirm standard 1L completion and good status, formally discuss and choose maintenance versus surveillance strategy.

{"chair":"- Post-NACT interval surgery for high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma; continue adjuvant platinum-taxane to complete standard first-line course if tolerable.  \n- Clarify FIGO stage, residual disease status, and completeness of cytoreduction from op note/path report before finalizing adjuvant strategy.  \n- Consider maintenance approach post-chemotherapy completion, tailored to BRCA/HRD-negative status and response depth (CA125, imaging).  \n- Urgently confirm and manage left ovarian vein thrombosis (anticoagulation plan, duration) and assess bleeding/VTE risk.  \n- Update ECOG performance status, current symptoms, full labs (CBC, renal, hepatic) and latest post-op imaging before firm treatment decisions.","oncologist":"- High-grade serous ovarian cancer, bilateral, post-surgery on 2023-06-21 with adjuvant first-line platinum/taxane ongoing; completion status unclear.  \n- CA125 markedly decreased from >1000 to 81.5 by 2023-07-20, suggesting response, but imaging correlation is unknown/needs update.  \n- HRD- and BRCA-wildtype germline and somatic; impacts maintenance options and expected benefit from targeted agents.  \n- Organ function, ECOG performance, residual disease status (R0/R1/R2), and detailed imaging after surgery are unknown/need update.  \n- Clarify chemotherapy plan: intended total cycles, tolerance/toxicities, and whether any maintenance strategy has been started or planned.","radiologist":"- CT shows adnexal mass with omental/mesenteric nodules and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, compatible with peritoneal metastatic disease [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2023-04-21].  \n\n- Sigmoid colon wall thickening; direct visualization (endoscopy) needed to assess for primary or secondary involvement [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2023-04-21].  \n\n- Postoperative abdominopelvic peritoneal haziness with effusion; differentiate evolving postsurgical change from residual peritoneal disease on follow-up imaging [@IMAGING_STUDIES|Unknown].  \n\n- Left ovarian vein thrombosis present; requires correlation for anticoagulation management and interval imaging to document stability/resolution [@IMAGING_STUDIES|Unknown].  \n\n- No interval or RECIST-style trend data; updated contrast-enhanced CT or MRI needed to assess current disease burden and treatment response.","pathologist":"- Histology consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma involving bilateral ovaries and multiple peritoneal/serosal sites, post-treatment changes noted [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2023-06-21].  \n- Exact primary site (fimbrial tube vs ovarian vs peritoneal) not explicitly assigned; clarification from original full report needed.  \n- No formal FIGO stage documented; based on described spread, stage IIIC–IV likely but needs explicit staging confirmation.  \n- BRCA1/2 wildtype and HRD-negative status documented; TP53 and PIK3CA mutations reported, but detailed molecular report/date are missing [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2023-06-21].  \n- IHC panel (WT1, p53 pattern, ER/PR, PAX8, Ki-67, MMR proteins) not provided; full IHC report needed.","nuclear":"- No PET/CT imaging is available; metabolic disease distribution and intensity are currently unknown/needs update.  \n\n- Prior CT shows adnexal mass with omental/mesenteric nodules and sigmoid thickening, suspicious for peritoneal carcinomatosis and possible bowel involvement [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|2023-04-21].  \n\n- Postoperative abdominopelvic haziness and effusion may represent postoperative change versus residual peritoneal disease; distinction needs PET/CT correlation [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|Unknown].  \n\n- PET/CT would help differentiate postoperative inflammation from viable tumor and refine staging or recurrence suspicion, especially in peritoneum and bowel.  \n\n- For further opinion, upload most recent PET/CT report and images, plus operative/pathology details and current tumor markers."}

  **Assistant:** Key Knowledge:
- High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, bilateral, with peritoneal/omental/serosal involvement; likely FIGO IIIC–IV but not formally documented.
- Interval debulking surgery 21/06/2023; degree of cytoreduction (R0/R1/R2) not clearly stated.
- First-line platinum–taxane chemotherapy given post-op; total planned and completed cycles, tolerance, and current status unclear.
- CA125 fell from >1000 to 81.5 by 20/07/2023, suggesting treatment response, but no correlated RECIST/imaging assessment.
- BRCA1/2 wildtype and HRD-negative; TP53 and PIK3CA mutations reported; germline and somatic BRCA/HRD status impact maintenance options.
- Imaging shows peritoneal carcinomatosis with retroperitoneal nodes; sigmoid thickening possibly secondary involvement; postoperative haziness/effusion may be residual disease vs postsurgical change.
- Left ovarian vein thrombosis documented radiologically.

Controversies:
- Exact FIGO stage and primary designation (fimbrial tube vs ovarian vs peritoneal) not finalized.
- Completeness of cytoreduction and residual disease burden uncertain, which affects adjuvant and maintenance decisions.
- True extent of residual/post-treatment disease vs postoperative change not yet clarified on interval imaging.
- Optimal maintenance strategy in BRCA/HRD-negative disease (PARP vs bevacizumab vs observation) in context of response depth and toxicity risk is not determined.

Missing Info:
- Full operative note, explicit FIGO stage, and R0/R1/R2 status.
- Up-to-date contrast-enhanced CT/MRI or PET/CT with RECIST assessment and documentation of left ovarian vein thrombosis evolution.
- Current ECOG performance status, symptom burden, and full labs (CBC, renal, hepatic, coagulation).
- Detailed chemotherapy history: number of cycles, dates, dosing, toxicities, and whether treatment has been completed or interrupted.
- Complete pathology/IHC panel (WT1, p53 pattern, ER/PR, PAX8, Ki-67, MMR) and full molecular report.
- Anticoagulation status and VTE/bleeding risk assessment for ovarian vein thrombosis.
- Endoscopic evaluation/outcome for sigmoid colon thickening, if performed.

Working Plan:
- Clarify staging and surgical outcome from operative and pathology reports before finalizing systemic and maintenance strategies.
- If tolerated and not yet completed, proceed to complete standard first-line platinum–taxane course.
- Obtain updated imaging (CT with contrast; consider PET/CT) to differentiate residual disease from postoperative change and to assess treatment response.
- Confirm and actively manage left ovarian vein thrombosis with a defined anticoagulation plan and follow-up imaging.
- After chemotherapy completion and response assessment (CA125 + imaging), discuss maintenance options appropriate for BRCA/HRD-negative status versus surveillance.
- Ensure ECOG status, labs, and toxicity profile are reviewed to guide intensity of further systemic therapy and anticoagulation.
