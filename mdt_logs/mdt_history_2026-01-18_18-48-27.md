## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Metastatic recurrent malignancy with progressive liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease and severe anemia; primary site, histology, stage, prior treatments, and current performance status remain undefined [@2022-12-29|CT][@2022-12-29|MR][@20230103|5600862].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently repeat CBC, full anemia workup, and assess for transfusion/bleeding to stabilize before biopsy/systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Retrieve all prior pathology/IHC and full oncologic treatment records to define primary site, histology, and treatment line (currently unknown).  
- Arrange whole-body FDG PET/CT coordinated with image-guided biopsy of safest liver lesion for updated pathology and molecular profiling [@2022-12-29|CT].  
- After pathology and staging clarification, reconvene MDT to choose non‑HRD‑oriented systemic category and symptom‑directed local palliation [@OH2203828|2022-04-18][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  

Change Triggers:
- If anemia remains unstable or symptomatic despite optimization, defer invasive biopsy/systemic therapy and prioritize stabilization and supportive care.  
- If new tissue/IHC shows non‑gynecologic or unexpected primary, shift from gynecologic pathway to site‑specific systemic and palliative strategy.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive presacral mass, bone and liver metastases; high CA125, CA19‑9 elevation [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@20221229|9703212].  
- Significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) likely multifactorial; urgently clarify symptoms, hemodynamics, and need for transfusion before systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Liver and renal function currently acceptable for systemic treatment; continue to monitor closely during any therapy [@20221229|8300002].  
- HRD/BRCA negative; consider non‑HRD–focused systemic strategies and clinical trials rather than PARP‑driven approaches [@OH2203828][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|15].  
- Missing: current histology/stage, prior treatments, performance status, pain/neurologic status, patient goals; obtain before definitive systemic vs local palliation plan.
```


## oncologist

```
- Diagnosis, disease stage, prior systemic treatments, and current disease status are unknown/needs update to define treatment intent and line.  

- HRD-negative, BRCA1/2 wild-type; germline ATM variant; implications for PARP/DDR-targeted strategies limited [@report_id:OH2203828|2022-04-18].  

- Anemia (Hgb 74 g/L, RBC 2.84×10¹²/L) may constrain myelosuppressive regimens; etiology and transfusion/iron status need update [@20230103|2023-01-03].  

- Renal and hepatic function appear adequate for most systemic therapies; confirm current values and trend before new regimen [@20221229|2022-12-29].  

- Tumor markers markedly elevated (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3); need imaging and pathology update to correlate with disease burden [@20221229|2022-12-29].
```


## radiologist

```
- Presacral pelvic mass at vaginal stump, now 53×44 mm with heterogeneous enhancement, invading adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, consistent with local recurrence. [@2022-12-29|MR]

- Multiple enhancing nodules in pelvic mesentery unchanged from prior, suspicious for peritoneal metastatic disease. [@2022-12-29|MR]

- New enhancing nodule in right iliac bone, suspicious for osseous metastasis. [@2022-12-29|MR]

- Liver with multiple metastatic nodules, increased number and size versus October 2022; coexisting stable hepatic cysts. [@2022-12-29|CT]

- Splenic patchy low-density area possibly infarct; recommend correlation with symptoms and follow-up imaging. [@2022-12-29|CT]
```


## pathologist

```
- No histology or IHC reports are available; tumor type, primary site, and grade remain completely undefined (needs surgical pathology report).  
- Germline ATM exon8 c.A947G p.Y316C variant reported; clinical significance for this case not specified [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- HRD testing reported negative; BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, BARD1 show no pathogenic variants detected [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- Somatic tumor sequencing results are not documented; updated tumor NGS/HRR panel from most recent tissue, if done, is needed.  
- Correlation of this germline panel with a specific malignancy is impossible without updated pathology diagnosis and staging information.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT available; metabolic characterization of liver, pelvic, and bone lesions currently impossible—FDG PET/CT needed for staging update.  

- CT shows multiple enlarging liver low-density nodules, radiologically consistent with progressive hepatic metastases, not yet metabolically confirmed [@2022-12-29|CT].  

- Pelvic MRI indicates enlarging presacral mass with peritoneal and sacral involvement, suspicious for local recurrence and invasion [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- MRI also shows new enhancing right iliac bone lesion and mesenteric nodules, suspicious for osseous and peritoneal metastases [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- Need current whole-body FDG PET/CT to assess metabolic activity, confirm recurrence extent, and potentially upstage with additional distant lesions.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum, pelvic mesenteric nodules, new right iliac bone lesion, and progressive liver metastases; markedly elevated CA125/CA19‑9/CA15‑3.
- HRD negative, BRCA1/2 wild-type; germline ATM variant of unclear therapeutic relevance; no clear actionable DDR alterations.
- Significant anemia (Hgb ~74 g/L) likely multifactorial; renal and hepatic function currently adequate for systemic therapy.
- Overall picture of disseminated disease; possible splenic infarct on CT.
- Non‑gynecologic primary remains possible given lack of definitive pathology.

Controversies:
- Systemic therapy choice, line of treatment, and even primary tumor site cannot be defined without prior pathology, IHC, and treatment history.
- Priority and sequencing of systemic therapy versus local palliative measures (e.g., RT to sacrum/iliac bone) in the context of severe anemia.
- Clinical utility of the germline ATM variant for targeted therapy remains uncertain.
- Extent to which whole-body FDG PET/CT will change management versus adding diagnostic load in a patient with urgent anemia issues.

Missing Info:
- All historical surgical/biopsy pathology and IHC reports to define primary site, histology, and grade.
- Full oncologic history: diagnosis date, stages, systemic regimens, surgeries, radiotherapy, responses, and toxicities.
- Current clinical status: ECOG/PS, pain and neurologic symptoms (sacral/bone involvement), bleeding, constitutional symptoms, and patient goals/preferences.
- Updated labs: CBC, iron studies, hemolysis markers, renal/hepatic function, coagulation, and transfusion history.
- Any prior tumor NGS/somatic profiling and prior PET/CT, if performed.

Working Plan:
- Urgently retrieve and upload all historical pathology/IHC and oncology treatment records to define diagnosis, primary site, stage, and line of therapy.
- Perform updated clinical assessment (ECOG, symptom burden, neurologic exam, bleeding, goals of care).
- Repeat labs and urgently evaluate and manage anemia (including need for transfusion) before systemic treatment decisions.
- Coordinate a baseline whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine staging and metabolic burden, provided it does not delay anemia optimization or necessary urgent palliation.
- Radiology and nuclear medicine to coordinate PET/CT timing with any planned image‑guided biopsy to efficiently obtain tissue and staging information.
- Re-discuss in MDT once pathology, staging, and clinical status are clarified to define appropriate non‑HRD systemic options (including trials) and symptom‑directed local therapies (e.g., RT).
[R2T1 DELTA] radiologist->oncologist(missing): From imaging, liver lesions appear suitable for ultrasound/CT-guided biopsy; please indicate preferred target so we can plan alongside PET/CT. | radiologist->nuclear(missing): When scheduling PET/CT, please coordinate with us to allow same-day or sequential image-guided biopsy of a chosen lesion.
[R2T2 DELTA] chair->oncologist(unspecified): Please specify whether liver versus pelvic lesion biopsy is preferred, balancing diagnostic yield and procedural risk in this anemic patient, so radiology/nuclear can plan with PET/CT efficiently. | oncologist->radiologist(missing): Given the need for broad molecular profiling, I’d favor a liver lesion as the primary biopsy target; please select the safest, most accessible site and coordinate with nuclear for PET/CT‑linked scheduling.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before proposing any regimen, anemia (Hb 74 g/L) and performance status must be urgently clarified and stabilized, and prior systemic/locoregional treatments retrieved to define true line of therapy and intent.
- **chair → radiologist:** Given sacral invasion, iliac bone lesion, and progressive liver disease, please comment on imminent fracture/neurologic risk and whether targeted palliative RT fields are technically feasible now versus after systemic therapy.
- **chair → pathologist:** We need definitive pathology (primary site, histologic subtype/grade, IHC panel) from prior surgery/biopsies; if inconclusive or inaccessible, advise on the safest current biopsy site for confirmation.
- **chair → nuclear:** Please advise whether FDG PET/CT would meaningfully refine staging and guide selection/priority of systemic versus local palliative approaches in this disseminated setting.
- **oncologist → chair:** Before deciding on systemic therapy, we still lack definitive primary histology, full prior treatment history, and current ECOG; could we prioritize retrieving outside oncology/pathology records and documenting performance status today?
- **oncologist → radiologist:** Given the enlarging presacral mass with sacral invasion and new right iliac bone lesion, can you comment on feasibility and urgency of image‑guided biopsy targets and whether any features suggest a non‑gynecologic primary?
- **oncologist → pathologist:** Do we have any prior pathology blocks or reports (including IHC) that clarify primary site and subtype of this pelvic malignancy, or should we plan a new biopsy of the presacral or liver lesion?
- **oncologist → nuclear:** Would a whole-body FDG PET/CT meaningfully refine staging or identify an unknown primary and additional symptomatic sites to guide systemic vs palliative local therapy planning?
- **pathologist → chair:** No surgical pathology or IHC are available to define primary site, histologic type, or grade; please obtain and upload all prior biopsy/resection reports for accurate diagnosis correlation with current imaging.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** Before systemic decisions, a whole-body FDG PET/CT would clarify metabolic activity and full extent of liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal lesions for accurate current staging.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** Given progressive CT/MR lesions without prior PET, please consider scheduling a baseline whole-body FDG PET/CT to assess metabolic burden and detect additional occult metastases.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Systemic therapy planning should be deferred until we obtain prior pathology/oncology records and stabilize the severe anemia with updated labs and transfusion assessment.
- **chair → radiologist:** Please coordinate with nuclear medicine to sequence baseline whole-body FDG PET/CT alongside any planned future MRI/CT, avoiding redundant imaging and excessive contrast load.
- **chair → pathologist:** Kindly prioritize retrieval and upload of all historical pathology/IHC reports; without a defined primary and histology, current treatment stratification remains unsafe.
- **chair → nuclear:** Agree PET/CT is valuable, but please confirm it will not delay urgent anemia workup/optimization or symptomatic local measures if needed.
- **oncologist → chair:** Given disseminated disease with severe anemia and unclear primary or line of therapy, could we prioritize obtaining prior pathology/systemic treatment records and arranging urgent labs/transfusion assessment before committing to a new systemic regimen?
- **oncologist → radiologist:** In light of nuclear’s recommendation for baseline whole-body PET/CT, can you help coordinate PET timing with potential image-guided biopsy so both staging and tissue diagnosis needs are efficiently addressed?

### Round 2

#### Turn 1
- **radiologist → oncologist:** From imaging, liver lesions appear suitable for ultrasound/CT-guided biopsy; please indicate preferred target so we can plan alongside PET/CT.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** When scheduling PET/CT, please coordinate with us to allow same-day or sequential image-guided biopsy of a chosen lesion.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Please specify whether liver versus pelvic lesion biopsy is preferred, balancing diagnostic yield and procedural risk in this anemic patient, so radiology/nuclear can plan with PET/CT efficiently.
- **oncologist → radiologist:** Given the need for broad molecular profiling, I’d favor a liver lesion as the primary biopsy target; please select the safest, most accessible site and coordinate with nuclear for PET/CT‑linked scheduling.

- Schedule whole-body FDG PET/CT to characterize metabolic activity and full extent of liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease [@2022-12-29|CT][@2022-12-29|MR].  
- Coordinate PET/CT with planned image-guided biopsy of the safest, metabolically active liver lesion to maximize diagnostic and molecular yield [@2022-12-29|CT].  
- Ensure PET/CT and biopsy timing do not delay urgent anemia evaluation, optimization, or necessary rapid palliative interventions (e.g., for sacral/iliac pain).  
- Use PET/CT to assess for additional symptomatic or impending-complication sites (e.g., spine, weight-bearing bone, bowel/ureter involvement) to inform local palliation.  
- Compare upcoming PET/CT with any future imaging to monitor metabolic response or progression once a treatment strategy is defined (if pursued).

Metastatic recurrent malignancy with progressive liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease and severe anemia; primary site, histology, stage, prior treatments, and current performance status remain undefined [@2022-12-29|CT][@2022-12-29|MR][@20230103|5600862].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently repeat CBC, full anemia workup, and assess for transfusion/bleeding to stabilize before biopsy/systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Retrieve all prior pathology/IHC and full oncologic treatment records to define primary site, histology, and treatment line (currently unknown).  
- Arrange whole-body FDG PET/CT coordinated with image-guided biopsy of safest liver lesion for updated pathology and molecular profiling [@2022-12-29|CT].  
- After pathology and staging clarification, reconvene MDT to choose non‑HRD‑oriented systemic category and symptom‑directed local palliation [@OH2203828|2022-04-18][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  

Change Triggers:
- If anemia remains unstable or symptomatic despite optimization, defer invasive biopsy/systemic therapy and prioritize stabilization and supportive care.  
- If new tissue/IHC shows non‑gynecologic or unexpected primary, shift from gynecologic pathway to site‑specific systemic and palliative strategy.

- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum, pelvic mesenteric nodules, new right iliac bone lesion, and progressive liver metastases; markedly elevated CA125/CA19‑9/CA15‑3.
- HRD negative, BRCA1/2 wild-type; germline ATM variant of unclear therapeutic relevance; no clear actionable DDR alterations.
- Significant anemia (Hgb ~74 g/L) likely multifactorial; renal and hepatic function currently adequate for systemic therapy.
- Overall picture of disseminated disease; possible splenic infarct on CT.
- Non‑gynecologic primary remains possible given lack of definitive pathology.

Controversies:
- Systemic therapy choice, line of treatment, and even primary tumor site cannot be defined without prior pathology, IHC, and treatment history.
- Priority and sequencing of systemic therapy versus local palliative measures (e.g., RT to sacrum/iliac bone) in the context of severe anemia.
- Clinical utility of the germline ATM variant for targeted therapy remains uncertain.
- Extent to which whole-body FDG PET/CT will change management versus adding diagnostic load in a patient with urgent anemia issues.

Missing Info:
- All historical surgical/biopsy pathology and IHC reports to define primary site, histology, and grade.
- Full oncologic history: diagnosis date, stages, systemic regimens, surgeries, radiotherapy, responses, and toxicities.
- Current clinical status: ECOG/PS, pain and neurologic symptoms (sacral/bone involvement), bleeding, constitutional symptoms, and patient goals/preferences.
- Updated labs: CBC, iron studies, hemolysis markers, renal/hepatic function, coagulation, and transfusion history.
- Any prior tumor NGS/somatic profiling and prior PET/CT, if performed.

Working Plan:
- Urgently retrieve and upload all historical pathology/IHC and oncology treatment records to define diagnosis, primary site, stage, and line of therapy.
- Perform updated clinical assessment (ECOG, symptom burden, neurologic exam, bleeding, goals of care).
- Repeat labs and urgently evaluate and manage anemia (including need for transfusion) before systemic treatment decisions.
- Coordinate a baseline whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine staging and metabolic burden, provided it does not delay anemia optimization or necessary urgent palliation.
- Radiology and nuclear medicine to coordinate PET/CT timing with any planned image‑guided biopsy to efficiently obtain tissue and staging information.
- Re-discuss in MDT once pathology, staging, and clinical status are clarified to define appropriate non‑HRD systemic options (including trials) and symptom‑directed local therapies (e.g., RT).
[R2T1 DELTA] radiologist->oncologist(missing): From imaging, liver lesions appear suitable for ultrasound/CT-guided biopsy; please indicate preferred target so we can plan alongside PET/CT. | radiologist->nuclear(missing): When scheduling PET/CT, please coordinate with us to allow same-day or sequential image-guided biopsy of a chosen lesion.
[R2T2 DELTA] chair->oncologist(unspecified): Please specify whether liver versus pelvic lesion biopsy is preferred, balancing diagnostic yield and procedural risk in this anemic patient, so radiology/nuclear can plan with PET/CT efficiently. | oncologist->radiologist(missing): Given the need for broad molecular profiling, I’d favor a liver lesion as the primary biopsy target; please select the safest, most accessible site and coordinate with nuclear for PET/CT‑linked scheduling.

- Coordinate PET/CT with planned image-guided biopsy of the safest, metabolically active liver lesion to maximize diagnostic and molecular yield [@2022-12-29|CT].  
- Ensure PET/CT and biopsy timing do not delay urgent anemia evaluation, optimization, or necessary rapid palliative interventions (e.g., for sacral/iliac pain).  
- Use PET/CT to assess for additional symptomatic or impending-complication sites (e.g., spine, weight-bearing bone, bowel/ureter involvement) to inform local palliation.  
- Compare upcoming PET/CT with any future imaging to monitor metabolic response or progression once a treatment strategy is defined (if pursued).
