genetics lab to clarify ATM variant classification.\n- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine mapping of bone/peritoneal disease, but do not allow PET/CT to delay necessary systemic palliation once diagnosis and goals are defined.\n- Reconvene MDT after data collection to define intent (palliative), and plan systemic therapy and any symptom-directed local measures in line with patient goals.", "timestamp": "2026-01-18T18:33:56.313776"}]}, "trace_events": [{"ts": "2026-01-18T18:31:48.092101", "event": "pipeline_start", "payload": {"visit_time": "2023-01-03 08:53:29.260000", "meta_info": "340123197709263626"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:31:48.092269", "event": "case_fingerprint", "payload": {"case_fingerprint": "bf21a9e8fbc5"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:31:48.385473", "event": "reports_loaded", "payload": {"lab_n": 92, "img_n": 10, "path_n": 0, "mut_n": 1, "cutoff_dt": "2023-01-04 08:53:29"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:00.308211", "event": "reports_selected", "payload": {"lab": {"chair": ["20221229|8300002|2022-12-29", "20221229|9703212|2022-12-29", "20230103|5600862|2023-01-03"], "oncologist": ["20221229|8300002|2022-12-29", "20221229|9703212|2022-12-29", "20230103|5600862|2023-01-03"], "radiologist": [], "pathologist": [], "nuclear": []}, "imaging": {"chair": ["2022-10-24|MR|2022-10-24", "2022-12-29|MR|2022-12-29", "2022-12-29|CT|2022-12-29"], "oncologist": [], "radiologist": ["2022-10-24|CT|2022-10-24", "2022-12-29|MR|2022-12-29", "2022-12-29|CT|2022-12-29"], "pathologist": [], "nuclear": ["2022-10-24|CT|2022-10-24", "2022-12-29|MR|2022-12-29", "2022-12-29|CT|2022-12-29"]}, "pathology": {"chair": [], "oncologist": [], "radiologist": [], "pathologist": [], "nuclear": []}, "mutation": {"chair": ["OH2203828|2022-04-18"], "oncologist": ["OH2203828|2022-04-18"], "radiologist": [], "pathologist": ["OH2203828|2022-04-18"], "nuclear": []}}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:16.475134", "event": "rag_query", "payload": {"query": "Guidelines for management of platinum-unknown ovarian cancer (histology not specified) with unspecified metastatic extent and no reported molecular markers or major comorbidities/organ dysfunction, including recommended systemic therapy options and indications for targeted or maintenance treatments."}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:16.475149", "event": "rag_hits", "payload": {"source": "guideline", "topk": 5, "n": 5}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:16.475152", "event": "rag_hits", "payload": {"source": "pubmed", "topk": 5, "n": 5}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:16.475155", "event": "rag_hits_merged", "payload": {"n": 10}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:24.288473", "event": "mdt_discussion_start", "payload": {"num_rounds": 2, "num_turns": 2}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:32:27.127028", "event": "evidence_tag_warning", "payload": {"role": "chair/initial", "preview": "- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive presacral mass, pelvic peritoneal disease and new multiple liver metastases by Dec 2022 [@2022-12-29|MR;…"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:35:00.783121", "event": "mdt_discussion_end", "payload": {"merged_chars": 2567}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:35:00.784015", "event": "final_output_start", "payload": {}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T18:35:06.269706", "event": "evidence_tag_warning", "payload": {"role": "chair/final_output", "preview": "Final Assessment: Disseminated metastatic pelvic malignancy with liver, presacral/sacral, mesenteric, rectal, and right iliac bone involvement [@2022-12-29|CT;
