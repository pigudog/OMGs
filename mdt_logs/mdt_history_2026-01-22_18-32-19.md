## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Post–primary debulking high‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma with nodal/peritoneal spread on 1L PARP maintenance, no radiologic recurrence, ECOG 1, but significant thrombocytopenia (PLT 33–34) temporally related to PARP therapy [@2021-08-26 | Pathology; @2022-04-18 | LAB; @2023-01-09 | LAB; @2022-05-23 | CASE]. HRD is positive but germline BRCA, CA‑125 trend, exact current PARP dose, full CBC/differential, and liver/renal function today are undocumented, limiting firm long‑term decisions. Imaging up to 2022‑10 shows no pelvic recurrence and stable extra‑pelvic findings [@2022-10-25 | MR; @2022-09-27 | CT; @2022-10-08 | CT].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Continue PARP maintenance only if today’s platelets and counts meet safe thresholds; otherwise hold and modify dose/schedule [@2022-04-18 | LAB].  
- Repeat full CBC, coagulation, liver/renal tests and CA‑125 today to guide toxicity management and surveillance intensity [@2023-01-09 | LAB].  
- Plan cross‑sectional imaging (CT or MRI abdomen/pelvis ± chest) within ~3–6 months, or sooner if CA‑125/symptoms change [@2022-10-25 | MR].  

Change Triggers:
- If platelets remain < safe maintenance threshold or bleeding occurs, stop PARP and consider alternative maintenance/surveillance approach.  
- If imaging or CA‑125 suggests recurrence, re‑stage and switch from maintenance to systemic relapse therapy planning, including platinum sensitivity assessment.

- **User:** 
As the MDT chair for gynecologic oncology, you are seeing the patient at OUTPATIENT TIME: 2023-01-09 09:23:13.113000.
Based on the case information provided in your system prompt, determine the CURRENT best management plan for this visit.

NOTE: This is the simplest mode without RAG knowledge (guidelines/PubMed).
You should clearly indicate what additional information would be needed for more definitive recommendations.

IMPORTANT: Any factual statement from the case data MUST include evidence tag:
- For lab results: [@date | LAB] (e.g., [@2022-01-17 | LAB])
- For imaging findings: [@date | MR] or [@date | CT]
- For genetic testing: [@date | Genomics]
- For pathology: [@date | Pathology]
- For surgery/treatment history: [@date | CASE]
Always use spaces around | for consistency.
