## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:  
Recurrent, platinum‑resistant ovarian clear cell carcinoma with progressive liver, presacral/sacral and iliac bone metastases despite 1L platinum therapy [@2022-03-28 | CASE; @2022-12-30 | MR; @2022-12-30 | CT]. Tumor markers are rapidly rising, confirming active systemic disease [@2022-12-29 | LAB]. Key missing data: performance status, comorbidities, pain/symptom burden, prior maintenance, and germline/somatic BRCA/HRD and other molecular profiling.

Core Treatment Strategy:  
- Initiate second‑line systemic therapy for platinum‑resistant disease; avoid further platinum, given PFI 56 days [@2022-08-17 | CASE].  
- Obtain germline and somatic molecular testing (BRCA, HRD, MSI, TMB, actionable targets) to refine future systemic/clinical‑trial options.  
- Refer to radiation/pain team to evaluate palliative treatment for presacral/sacral/right iliac bone lesions and symptom control [@2022-12-30 | MR].  

Change Triggers:  
- If performance status poor or major comorbidities identified, shift from active multi‑agent therapy toward symptom‑focused palliative care.  
- If molecular testing reveals targetable alterations, pivot to appropriate targeted or immunotherapy strategy rather than standard chemotherapy alone.

### chair
- **User:** 
As the MDT chair for gynecologic oncology, you are seeing the patient at OUTPATIENT TIME: 2023-01-03 08:53:29.260000.
Based on the case information provided in your system prompt, determine the CURRENT best management plan for this visit.

NOTE: This is the simplest mode without RAG knowledge (guidelines/PubMed).
You should clearly indicate what additional information would be needed for more definitive recommendations.

IMPORTANT: Any factual statement from the case data MUST include evidence tag:
- For lab results: [@date | LAB] (e.g., [@2022-01-17 | LAB])
- For imaging findings: [@date | MR] or [@date | CT]
- For genetic testing: [@date | Genomics]
- For pathology: [@date | Pathology]
- For surgery/treatment history: [@date | CASE]
Always use spaces around | for consistency.

# Response Format (follow OMGs standard format)
Final Assessment:
<1–3 sentences: summarize case, current status, and key uncertainties/missing data. Include evidence tags for any facts cited.>
