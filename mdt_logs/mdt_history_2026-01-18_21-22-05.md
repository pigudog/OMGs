## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Systemic recurrent pelvic malignancy with hepatic and osseous metastases and severe anemia, but tumor origin, prior therapy, and current extent remain insufficiently defined for safe systemic treatment decisions. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT] [@20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Defer new systemic regimen and trial enrollment until full pathology, prior oncologic treatments, and performance status are clarified. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11]  
- Obtain and review complete pathology (primary and any metastases, including IHC, grade, stage) to define tumor origin and subtype. unknown/needs update  
- Arrange updated CT/MR and consider PET/CT to restage, assess obstruction/neurologic risk, and confirm current metastatic burden. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT] [@pubmed:35296733]  
- Urgently evaluate and manage anemia/lymphopenia (workup, transfusion as indicated) before any myelosuppressive therapy. [@20230103|5600862]

Change Triggers:
- If pathology confirms epithelial ovarian origin, align with epithelial ovarian systemic pathways, considering limited PARP role in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11] [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]  
- If updated imaging or symptoms reveal obstruction, neurologic compromise, or fracture risk, prioritize urgent local/palliative interventions before systemic therapy. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT]

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with liver and bone metastases; urgent MDT to clarify histology, prior treatments, performance status, and goals. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT]  

- Severe anemia and relative lymphopenia require immediate evaluation (reticulocytes, iron/B12/folate, stool/bleeding review) and optimization before systemic therapy. [@20230103|5600862]  

- HRD-negative, BRCA-wildtype status suggests limited PARP benefit; consider standard systemic and trial options per epithelial ovarian cancer paradigms. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11] [@2022-04-18|OH2203828]
```


## oncologist

```
- Primary cancer diagnosis, staging, prior systemic therapy, and treatment intent are unknown/needs update to define line and goals of care.

- Germline ATM variant with HRD-, BRCA1/2-, and other tested genes negative; implications for PARP-based maintenance limited [@OH2203828|2022-04-18] [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].

- Significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with preserved renal and near-normal liver function; optimize counts before myelosuppressive regimens [@20230103|2023-01-03] [@20221229|2022-12-29].
```


## radiologist

```
- Pelvic MRI: enlarging 53×44 mm presacral mass involving adjacent peritoneum, sacrum, plus pelvic mesenteric nodules—progressive recurrence/metastases. [@2022-12-29|MR]

- Pelvic MRI: right iliac bone enhancing nodule suggests new osseous metastasis; rectal wall thickening may indicate local invasion or inflammation. [@2022-12-29|MR]

- CT: multiple hepatic metastases increasing in number/size, with stable hepatic cysts; splenic low-density focus possibly infarct—requires imaging follow‑up. [@2022-12-29|CT]
```


## pathologist

```
- Only molecular finding: germline ATM p.Y316C with HRD negative; BRCA1/2, TP53, others tested negative [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  

- Histologic diagnosis, grade, FIGO stage, and IHC profile are completely missing; primary pathology report and addenda need upload/update.  

- For epithelial ovarian cancer, early HRD/BRCA testing is standard; here HRD negative and BRCA1/2 wild-type [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT or FDG-PET reports available; metabolic characterization of pelvic, hepatic, and bony lesions is unknown/needs update.  

- CT/MR show progressive pelvic mass with possible sacral, peritoneal, hepatic, and iliac bone metastases, concerning for systemic recurrence [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT].  

- FDG-PET could refine staging, detect additional metastases, and better assess recurrence extent in ovarian/pelvic malignancy workup [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced, recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral, peritoneal, sacral, hepatic, and probable right iliac bone metastases (osseous disease documented by 2022‑12) → systemic disease.
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with relative lymphopenia; renal and hepatic function largely preserved.
- Molecular profile: germline ATM p.Y316C; HRD- and BRCA‑wildtype → limited expected benefit from PARP inhibitors; epithelial ovarian cancer pathway only provisional.
- No PET/CT performed; metabolic characterization and full disease extent remain undefined.

Controversies:
- Primary site and histologic subtype (ovarian vs other pelvic origin) not pathologically confirmed; current working label of epithelial ovarian cancer is unsupported by documented histology/IHC.
- Line of therapy and prior systemic treatment history unclear, limiting safe regimen selection and trial eligibility assessment.
- Clinical actionability of isolated germline ATM variant in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease remains uncertain for current systemic strategy.

Missing Info:
- Full pathology for primary and any recurrent/metastatic sites: histology, grade, FIGO stage, IHC profile, and complete reports/addenda.
- Comprehensive oncologic treatment history: surgeries, chemo regimens, radiotherapy, maintenance (including PARP), timelines, responses.
- Updated imaging since 2022‑12 (CT/MR/PET), including assessment of liver, bone, and possible splenic lesion; any signs of obstruction, nerve/spinal compromise, or fracture risk.
- Detailed anemia workup and transfusion/bleeding history.
- Current performance status, symptom burden (incl. pain, bowel/bladder function), comorbidities, medications (esp. anticoagulants), and patient goals/intent.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review full pathology (primary and metastatic, with IHC) and clarify the diagnostic basis for any presumed epithelial ovarian origin before defining systemic strategy.
- Retrieve complete prior treatment record and establish the current line of therapy and treatment intent.
- Urgently investigate and manage anemia and lymphopenia before considering myelosuppressive systemic therapy.
- Arrange updated cross‑sectional imaging and consider PET/CT to refine staging and identify complications (obstruction, neurologic compromise, fracture risk).
- Defer systemic regimen choice and trial consideration until pathology, staging, and prior treatment history are clarified; then align options with performance status and patient‑stated goals, including palliative‑focused care if appropriate.
[R2T1 DELTA] radiologist->oncologist(safety): Last MR/CT (2022-12) already showed progressive presacral, hepatic, and bone metastases; without updated imaging, current risks of obstruction or neurologic compromise remain undefined and should be re-imaged before finalizing systemic plans.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before choosing further systemic therapy, we must clarify full prior treatment history, performance status, and correct the marked anemia (including transfusion need) to avoid unsafe myelosuppressive plans.
- **chair → pathologist:** Please urgently provide complete pathology (primary site, histologic subtype, grade, IHC, stage) to resolve current uncertainty over tumor origin and guide systemic strategy.
- **oncologist → pathologist:** Primary site and histologic subtype remain unclear; please prioritize review of all available tissue, including IHC and any addenda, to definitively classify origin and grade to guide systemic strategy.
- **oncologist → nuclear:** Given multifocal metastases without PET/CT, please advise on urgency and utility of whole-body PET/CT now to better stage disease and assess bone/splenic involvement before systemic regimen decisions.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Imaging shows progressive presacral, hepatic, and probable osseous metastases as of 2022-12; any new scans or symptoms suggesting complications (bowel/bladder obstruction, pathologic fracture, severe pain) since then should be documented.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** Last cross-sectional imaging is from 2022-12; given progressive multi-organ metastases, please clarify if a PET/CT has since been done or is planned for updated staging and treatment planning.
- **pathologist → chair:** Current MDT plan assumes epithelial ovarian cancer, but no pathology report or IHC confirmation is available; diagnostic basis for this working diagnosis needs explicit clarification and documentation.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** Primary histology, grade, FIGO stage, and IHC profile remain entirely undocumented; please obtain and upload full pathology (including any biopsies of recurrent/metastatic sites) before refining diagnosis or systemic strategy.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** No PET/CT has been performed; metabolic assessment of suspected hepatic, bone, and peritoneal metastases is missing and could meaningfully refine current staging and recurrence evaluation.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Please avoid locking in an epithelial ovarian cancer label until original and metastatic pathology (including IHC) are reviewed and documented; parallelly, address severe anemia and consider PET/CT to refine current staging before committing to a new systemic line.
- **chair → radiologist:** Given progressive pelvic, hepatic, and bone disease on prior MR/CT, please flag any imaging or clinical signs of impending obstruction, spinal/nerve compromise, or fracture risk that would change urgency or sequence of local versus systemic measures.
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic regimen choice and trial eligibility are being considered without any pathology report or staging documented; decision-making should be deferred until full histology/IHC, prior treatment history, and updated imaging are available.

### Round 2

#### Turn 1
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Last MR/CT (2022-12) already showed progressive presacral, hepatic, and bone metastases; without updated imaging, current risks of obstruction or neurologic compromise remain undefined and should be re-imaged before finalizing systemic plans.

#### Turn 2

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral, peritoneal, sacral, hepatic, and probable right iliac bone metastases → systemic disease.
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with relative lymphopenia; kidney and liver function largely preserved.
- Germline ATM p.Y316C; HRD- and BRCA‑wildtype, suggesting limited benefit from PARP inhibitors and likely use of standard epithelial ovarian cancer paradigms if that primary is confirmed.
- No PET/CT performed; metabolic extent of disease not defined.

Controversies:
- Primary site and histologic subtype (ovarian vs other pelvic origin) remain uncertain.
- Line of therapy and prior systemic treatments not clearly established, complicating treatment selection and trial eligibility.
- Clinical relevance of isolated germline ATM variant in HRD-/BRCA‑wt setting for current management is unclear.

Missing Info:
- Complete pathology (histology, grade, FIGO stage, IHC, original and addenda reports).
- Full oncologic treatment history (surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, maintenance, PARP exposure, timelines, responses).
- Current performance status, symptom burden, and patient goals/intent.
- Detailed anemia workup (reticulocytes, iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, bleeding/stool review, transfusion history).
- Updated staging imaging including PET/CT (if obtained) and follow-up on possible splenic infarct.
- Comorbidities, current medications (including anticoagulants), and supportive care needs.

Working Plan:
- Retrieve and review original pathology and full oncology records to confirm diagnosis, staging, and treatment line/intent.
- Urgently investigate and treat anemia and optimize counts before any myelosuppressive systemic therapy.
- Consider PET/CT to better define overall metastatic burden (pelvis, liver, bone, spleen).
- Re‑evaluate systemic options using epithelial ovarian cancer pathways if confirmed, noting limited PARP role in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease.
- Align any further treatment with performance status and patient preferences, including discussion of palliative-focused approaches if appropriate.

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral, peritoneal, sacral, hepatic, and probable right iliac bone metastases → systemic disease.
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with relative lymphopenia; kidney and liver function largely preserved.
- Germline ATM p.Y316C; HRD- and BRCA‑wildtype, suggesting limited benefit from PARP inhibitors and likely use of standard epithelial ovarian cancer paradigms if that primary is confirmed.
- No PET/CT performed; metabolic extent of disease not defined.

Controversies:
- Primary site and histologic subtype (ovarian vs other pelvic origin) remain uncertain.
- Line of therapy and prior systemic treatments not clearly established, complicating treatment selection and trial eligibility.
- Clinical relevance of isolated germline ATM variant in HRD-/BRCA‑wt setting for current management is unclear.

Missing Info:
- Complete pathology (histology, grade, FIGO stage, IHC, original and addenda reports).
- Full oncologic treatment history (surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, maintenance, PARP exposure, timelines, responses).
- Current performance status, symptom burden, and patient goals/intent.
- Detailed anemia workup (reticulocytes, iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, bleeding/stool review, transfusion history).
- Updated staging imaging including PET/CT (if obtained) and follow-up on possible splenic infarct.
- Comorbidities, current medications (including anticoagulants), and supportive care needs.

Working Plan:
- Retrieve and review original pathology and full oncology records to confirm diagnosis, staging, and treatment line/intent.
- Urgently investigate and treat anemia and optimize counts before any myelosuppressive systemic therapy.
- Consider PET/CT to better define overall metastatic burden (pelvis, liver, bone, spleen).
- Re‑evaluate systemic options using epithelial ovarian cancer pathways if confirmed, noting limited PARP role in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease.
- Align any further treatment with performance status and patient preferences, including discussion of palliative-focused approaches if appropriate.

- Consider PET/CT to better define overall metastatic burden (pelvis, liver, bone, spleen).
- Re‑evaluate systemic options using epithelial ovarian cancer pathways if confirmed, noting limited PARP role in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease.
- Align any further treatment with performance status and patient preferences, including discussion of palliative-focused approaches if appropriate.
[R1T1 DELTA] le osseous metastases as of 2022-12; any new scans or symptoms suggesting complications (bowel/bladder obstruction, pathologic fracture, severe pain) since then should be documented. | pathologist->oncologist(missing): Primary histology, grade, FIGO stage, and IHC profile remain entirely undocumented; please obtain and upload full pathology (including any biopsies of recurrent/metastatic sites) before refining diagnosis or systemic strategy. | pathologist->chair(conflict): Current MDT plan assumes epithelial ovarian cancer, but no pathology report or IHC confirmation is available; diagnostic basis for this working diagnosis needs explicit clarification and documentation. | nuclear->oncologist(missing): No PET/CT has been performed; metabolic assessment of suspected hepatic, bone, and peritoneal metastases is missing and could meaningfully refine current staging and recurrence evaluation.
[R1T2 DELTA] chair->oncologist(conflict): Please avoid locking in an epithelial ovarian cancer label until original and metastatic pathology (including IHC) are reviewed and documented; parallelly, address severe anemia and consider PET/CT to refine current staging before committing to a new systemic line. | chair->radiologist(safety): Given progressive pelvic, hepatic, and bone disease on prior MR/CT, please flag any imaging or clinical signs of impending obstruction, spinal/nerve compromise, or fracture risk that would change urgency or sequence of local versus systemic measures. | oncologist->chair(safety): Systemic regimen choice and trial eligibility are being considered without any pathology report or staging documented; decision-making should be deferred until full histology/IHC, prior treatment history, and updated imaging are available.

  **Assistant:** Key Knowledge:
- Advanced, recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral, peritoneal, sacral, hepatic, and probable right iliac bone metastases (osseous disease documented by 2022‑12) → systemic disease.
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with relative lymphopenia; renal and hepatic function largely preserved.
- Molecular profile: germline ATM p.Y316C; HRD- and BRCA‑wildtype → limited expected benefit from PARP inhibitors; epithelial ovarian cancer pathway only provisional.
- No PET/CT performed; metabolic characterization and full disease extent remain undefined.

Controversies:
- Primary site and histologic subtype (ovarian vs other pelvic origin) not pathologically confirmed; current working label of epithelial ovarian cancer is unsupported by documented histology/IHC.
- Line of therapy and prior systemic treatment history unclear, limiting safe regimen selection and trial eligibility assessment.
- Clinical actionability of isolated germline ATM variant in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease remains uncertain for current systemic strategy.

Missing Info:
- Full pathology for primary and any recurrent/metastatic sites: histology, grade, FIGO stage, IHC profile, and complete reports/addenda.
- Comprehensive oncologic treatment history: surgeries, chemo regimens, radiotherapy, maintenance (including PARP), timelines, responses.
- Updated imaging since 2022‑12 (CT/MR/PET), including assessment of liver, bone, and possible splenic lesion; any signs of obstruction, nerve/spinal compromise, or fracture risk.
- Detailed anemia workup and transfusion/bleeding history.
- Current performance status, symptom burden (incl. pain, bowel/bladder function), comorbidities, medications (esp. anticoagulants), and patient goals/intent.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review full pathology (primary and metastatic, with IHC) and clarify the diagnostic basis for any presumed epithelial ovarian origin before defining systemic strategy.
- Retrieve complete prior treatment record and establish the current line of therapy and treatment intent.
- Urgently investigate and manage anemia and lymphopenia before considering myelosuppressive systemic therapy.
- Arrange updated cross‑sectional imaging and consider PET/CT to refine staging and identify complications (obstruction, neurologic compromise, fracture risk).
- Defer systemic regimen choice and trial consideration until pathology, staging, and prior treatment history are clarified; then align options with performance status and patient‑stated goals, including palliative‑focused care if appropriate.
