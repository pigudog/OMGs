## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour (dysgerminoma‑predominant) post right adnexectomy and 2 BEP cycles, with a shrinking but indeterminate 1.8 cm left ovarian surface nodule and incomplete staging, organ-function, and fertility information.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Do not modify systemic‑therapy plan or schedule further cycles until FIGO stage, staging completeness, and organ function are clarified.
- Arrange unified post‑BEP restaging: contrast CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis ± chest plus whole‑body PET/FAPI to assess left nodule and extrapelvic disease.
- Request pathology addendum to provide full staging details (tumour size, capsule/surface, washings, extraovarian disease, FIGO stage, teratoma maturity).
- Implement standardized serial tumour markers (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) and document renal, pulmonary, marrow status and fertility goals to guide chemo vs fertility‑sparing surgery.

Change Triggers:
- If imaging/PET shows active left implant or additional disease, prioritize completion/optimization of systemic therapy and consider non‑fertility‑sparing surgery.
- If imaging/PET shows no active disease and markers normalize, consider limited fertility‑sparing surgery or surveillance rather than intensifying chemotherapy.
- If organ‑function assessment reveals significant BEP toxicity, de‑escalate or switch systemic approach and increase reliance on surgical/local control.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour post-right adnexectomy and 2 BEP cycles; left ovarian surface nodule now decreasing on MRI.  
- Clarify intent/completeness of initial staging surgery (omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies, lymph nodes, washings) and final FIGO stage – currently unknown.  
- Obtain full current pelvic/abdominal imaging report (including latest MRI with 1.8 cm nodule) and any FAPI schedule/results.  
- Continue systemic therapy planning as first‑line adjuvant/continued treatment, coordinating with fertility-sparing goals and potential delayed conservative surgery.  
- Monitor AFP, LDH, β‑hCG, CA125, NSE trends; β‑hCG, LDH, full tumour marker panel currently undocumented and need updating.
```


## oncologist

```
- Post-op mixed germ cell tumour with teratomatous component; fertility-sparing approach with residual left ovary requires careful staging confirmation (imaging/pathology).  

- Two cycles of first-line cisplatin-based combination completed; current treatment phase likely still primary/adjuvant rather than relapse therapy.  

- AFP normalized after chemotherapy, suggesting good marker response; CA125 and NSE roles as disease markers remain uncertain and need correlation.  

- Key missing: detailed pathology report (stage, margins, risk factors, teratoma maturity) and full imaging description of left ovarian nodule.  

- Also needed: current organ function (renal, pulmonary, marrow), toxicity history, and MDT fertility goals before deciding further cycles vs surveillance/surgery.
```


## radiologist

```
- Left ovarian surface solid nodule 1.8 cm, extra-surface location, suspicious for implantation deposit. [@Role-Specific-Case-View|Unknown]  

- Nodule has decreased in size compared with prior imaging, suggesting partial interval response/improvement. [@Role-Specific-Case-View|Unknown]  

- Postoperative pelvic changes with residual mass; precise size, margins, and composition not fully characterized. Needs updated cross-sectional imaging. [@Role-Specific-Case-View|2024-09-28]  

- Small pelvic effusion present; clinical significance and evolution uncertain without follow-up imaging. [@Role-Specific-Case-View|2024-09-27]  

- No PET/FAPI or contemporaneous whole-abdomen imaging available; staging and extra-pelvic disease assessment need updated CT/MRI ± PET.
```


## pathologist

```
- Diagnosis: Right ovarian mixed germ cell tumour, predominantly dysgerminoma with ~10% mature teratoma; necrosis and vascular proliferation present [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-09-02].  
- IHC profile (SALL4, Oct4, PLAP, D2-40, CD117 positive; AFP, GPC3, CD30 negative) strongly supports dysgerminoma; no yolk sac component [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-09-02].  
- Proliferation index high (Ki-67 ~80%), consistent with biologically active dysgerminoma component [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-09-02].  
- Current biomarkers: serum AFP <2; CA125 mildly elevated; no HER2, MSI, PD-L1, or TMB data [@MOLECULAR|2024-10-22].  
- Missing for complete pathology staging: tumour size, capsule status, surface involvement, nodal/extraovarian sampling, FIGO stage, margin status—needs surgical/pathology update.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET-CT reports available; metabolic status of the left adnexal/ovarian surface lesion is unknown/needs update.  

- Prior imaging suggests left adnexal/ovarian surface solid nodule, possibly implantation, but without metabolic characterization. [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|Unknown]  

- PET (FDG or FAPI per protocol) could help distinguish post-operative change from metabolically active residual or recurrent disease.  

- PET findings could upstage disease if additional hypermetabolic peritoneal/implantation sites or nodal involvement are identified beyond current CT impressions.  

- Request updated PET-CT (or FAPI-PET if available) report to refine staging and recurrence suspicion at/after this visit date.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour, predominantly dysgerminoma with ~10% mature teratoma; high Ki‑67; no yolk sac component on IHC.
- Fertility-sparing right adnexectomy; patient currently in first‑line/adjuvant setting after 2 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
- AFP has normalized (<2); CA125 mildly elevated; β‑hCG and LDH not yet reported.
- MRI: 1.8 cm solid nodule on the surface of the left ovary, suspicious for implantation but decreasing in size; small pelvic effusion.
- No PET/FAPI or full whole‑abdomen/chest staging imaging; extra‑pelvic disease status unknown.

Controversies:
- Extent and intent of initial surgery (full staging vs limited fertility-sparing) unclear; FIGO stage remains uncertain.
- Biological nature of the left ovarian surface nodule (implant vs residual teratoma vs postoperative/inflammatory change) unresolved.
- Appropriate balance and sequencing of further chemotherapy versus timing/extent of conservative/delayed surgery under fertility-sparing goals.
- Utility of CA125 and NSE as reliable disease markers in this case remains uncertain.

Missing Info:
- Full operative and pathology staging details (tumour size, capsule/surface involvement, omentum/peritoneal biopsies, nodal sampling, washings, margins, FIGO stage).
- Detailed histopathology including teratoma maturity and any extraovarian disease in original specimens.
- Updated cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI pelvis–abdomen ± chest) with full characterization of the 1.8 cm nodule (trend, enhancement, diffusion, relationship to cortex/peritoneum) and any peritoneal/omental implants.
- PET‑CT/FAPI‑PET status: whether planned, timing relative to chemotherapy, and optimal integration with CT/MRI for single staging timepoint.
- Serial tumour marker trends (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) with dates.
- Current organ function/toxicity after BEP (renal, pulmonary, marrow, ototoxicity) and clearly documented fertility-preservation priorities.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review complete operative and pathology reports to define FIGO stage and staging completeness, including potential for implantation to the left ovary.
- Request detailed re-evaluation/report of current imaging focusing on the left ovarian surface nodule and any peritoneal/omental disease; arrange updated CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis ± chest.
- Coordinate with nuclear medicine and radiology to schedule PET/FAPI at the same time as next contrast-enhanced CT/MRI (post-current chemo cycle or pre-major surgery) for metabolic characterization and global staging.
- Clarify systemic-therapy strategy within a first-line/adjuvant framework once staging, toxicity profile, and fertility goals are available.
- Implement standardized serial tumour marker monitoring (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) and integrate with imaging for response and surveillance planning.

## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before deciding on further chemotherapy versus interval conservative surgery, we must first obtain complete staging details, updated cross‑sectional imaging, and full tumour marker panel including β‑hCG and LDH with toxicity assessment post‑BEP.
- **chair → radiologist:** Please arrange and report comprehensive contrast-enhanced CT/MRI of abdomen–pelvis (±chest) to fully characterize the left ovarian surface nodule and search for peritoneal/extra‑pelvic disease; clarify timing/feasibility of planned FAPI/PET study.
- **chair → pathologist:** We need a detailed summary of the initial specimen: tumor size, capsule/surface status, teratoma maturity, margins, and any extraovarian involvement to support accurate FIGO staging.
- **chair → nuclear:** Confirm indication, protocol, and timing for FAPI/PET (or alternative PET) to assess metabolic activity of the left ovarian lesion and detect occult implants; results will directly influence systemic versus surgical strategy.
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic therapy decisions are limited by unclear FIGO stage and uncertain nature of the left ovarian lesion; prioritizing completion of staging information and updated imaging is critical before committing to more cycles or additional surgery in this fertility-sparing case.
- **oncologist → radiologist:** We need updated contrast-enhanced CT/MRI of abdomen–pelvis (±chest) with detailed characterization of the left ovarian surface nodule and any peritoneal/implant disease to determine if current therapy remains appropriate or if surgery should be escalated.
- **oncologist → pathologist:** Please provide full staging pathology details (FIGO stage, capsule/surface involvement, washings, omentum/biopsies, nodes, teratoma maturity, margins) to clarify risk and guide adjuvant intensity vs surgery timing.
- **oncologist → nuclear:** Confirm feasibility and timing of PET or FAPI-PET to assess metabolic activity of the left ovarian lesion and exclude occult extra-pelvic disease, which will influence further systemic therapy and fertility-sparing strategy.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Current imaging shows a 1.8 cm left ovarian surface nodule decreasing in size, but there is no up‑to‑date whole‑abdomen/chest imaging or PET/FAPI to confirm extent of disease or fully characterize this lesion; updated cross‑sectional and, if available, metabolic imaging are needed before making further surgical or systemic decisions.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** A decreasing 1.8 cm solid nodule on the left ovarian surface remains suspicious for implantation; no PET/FAPI or whole‑body metabolic study is documented, so feasibility and timing of FAPI‑PET (or equivalent) should be clarified for disease characterization and staging.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** Pathology and IHC confirm pure dysgerminoma plus mature teratoma without yolk sac elements; please update full staging details (capsule/surface, peritoneal/omentectomy, nodes, washings, margins, FIGO stage) so we can judge whether the left ovarian nodule represents possible implantation versus benign/secondary change.
- **pathologist → radiologist:** Given mixed germ cell histology with normalized AFP but uncertain stage, we need detailed re-evaluation of the left ovarian surface nodule (size trend, enhancement, diffusion, relation to cortex and peritoneum) and any peritoneal/omental implants on current cross-sectional imaging.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** Metabolic characterization of the left ovarian surface nodule is still completely absent; please confirm if PET/FAPI is planned and timing relative to ongoing chemotherapy.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** Given the unresolved 1.8 cm left ovarian surface lesion and unknown extra‑pelvic status, please advise on optimal timing and modality for PET/FAPI integration with planned cross‑sectional imaging.

#### Turn 2
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic-therapy planning remains constrained by uncertain FIGO stage, uncharacterized left ovarian surface lesion, and absent organ-function/toxicity data; further chemotherapy beyond two cycles should be deferred until pathology, imaging, and fertility goals are clarified.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** From an imaging workflow perspective, pairing PET/FAPI with the next contrast-enhanced CT or MRI abdomen–pelvis once the current chemotherapy cycle is completed (or just before major surgical decisions) would best characterize the 1.8 cm left ovarian surface lesion and detect extra‑pelvic disease in a single staging timepoint.

### Round 2

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before committing to further chemotherapy cycles, we need full staging details, updated cross-sectional imaging, and a clear statement of the patient’s fertility priorities to balance systemic therapy versus delayed conservative surgery.
- **chair → radiologist:** Please provide a detailed re-evaluation of the left ovarian surface nodule and peritoneum on updated contrast CT/MRI, and confirm feasibility/timing of combined CT/MRI plus PET/FAPI as a single staging timepoint post‑BEP.
- **chair → pathologist:** Kindly issue an addendum clarifying tumour size, capsule/surface involvement, washings, any extraovarian disease, teratoma maturity, and an assigned FIGO stage if possible.
- **chair → nuclear:** We need your plan for PET/FAPI: optimal timing relative to recent BEP, protocol details, and how best to integrate it with same‑day CT/MRI for comprehensive staging of the left ovarian lesion and any implants.

#### Turn 2
- **nuclear → chair:** I propose whole‑body FDG‑PET (or FAPI if available) scheduled with the next contrast CT/MRI after completion of the current BEP cycle, using a standard oncologic protocol (vertex–mid‑thigh, low‑dose CT for attenuation) to metabolically characterize the left ovarian surface nodule and detect any peritoneal/extra‑pelvic implants in a single staging session.


## FINAL REFINED PLANS (per Round)

### Round 1


## chair

```

- Correlate pathology with updated imaging of the left ovarian surface lesion to suggest most likely nature (implant vs teratoma vs benign).  
- Refrain from further pathology-based recommendations on chemotherapy or surgery until staging addendum and new imaging/markers are available (data incomplete).
```


## nuclear

```
- No prior PET/FAPI; metabolic status of the 1.8 cm left ovarian surface nodule remains unknown/needs update.  

- MRI shows a decreasing 1.8 cm left ovarian surface nodule with small pelvic effusion; etiology remains indeterminate (implant vs benign). [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|Unknown]

  **Assistant:** Final Assessment:
Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour (dysgerminoma‑predominant) post right adnexectomy and 2 BEP cycles, with a shrinking but indeterminate 1.8 cm left ovarian surface nodule and incomplete staging, organ-function, and fertility information.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Do not modify systemic‑therapy plan or schedule further cycles until FIGO stage, staging completeness, and organ function are clarified.
- Arrange unified post‑BEP restaging: contrast CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis ± chest plus whole‑body PET/FAPI to assess left nodule and extrapelvic disease.
- Request pathology addendum to provide full staging details (tumour size, capsule/surface, washings, extraovarian disease, FIGO stage, teratoma maturity).
- Implement standardized serial tumour markers (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) and document renal, pulmonary, marrow status and fertility goals to guide chemo vs fertility‑sparing surgery.

Change Triggers:
- If imaging/PET shows active left implant or additional disease, prioritize completion/optimization of systemic therapy and consider non‑fertility‑sparing surgery.
- If imaging/PET shows no active disease and markers normalize, consider limited fertility‑sparing surgery or surveillance rather than intensifying chemotherapy.
- If organ‑function assessment reveals significant BEP toxicity, de‑escalate or switch systemic approach and increase reliance on surgical/local control.

If key data missing, say exactly what needs updating.
  
  **Assistant:** - Post-op mixed germ cell tumour with teratomatous component; fertility-sparing approach with residual left ovary requires careful staging confirmation (imaging/pathology).  

- Two cycles of first-line cisplatin-based combination completed; current treatment phase likely still primary/adjuvant rather than relapse therapy.  

- AFP normalized after chemotherapy, suggesting good marker response; CA125 and NSE roles as disease markers remain uncertain and need correlation.  

- Key missing: detailed pathology report (stage, margins, risk factors, teratoma maturity) and full imaging description of left ovarian nodule.  

- Also needed: current organ function (renal, pulmonary, marrow), toxicity history, and MDT fertility goals before deciding further cycles vs surveillance/surgery.

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour, predominantly dysgerminoma with ~10% mature teratoma; high Ki‑67 and classic dysgerminoma IHC; no yolk sac component.
- Fertility-sparing right adnexectomy performed; current treatment is first‑line/adjuvant post-surgery with 2 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
- AFP has normalized (<2); CA125 mildly elevated; β‑hCG and LDH not yet documented.
- MRI shows a 1.8 cm solid nodule on the surface of the left ovary, suspicious for implantation but decreasing in size; small pelvic effusion present.
- No PET/FAPI or full whole‑abdomen staging imaging available; extra‑pelvic disease status unknown.

Controversies:
- Unclear whether the original operation was a full staging procedure, so FIGO stage is uncertain.
- Nature of the left ovarian surface lesion (regressing active disease vs residual teratoma vs postoperative/inflammatory change) remains unresolved.
- Best balance between further systemic therapy and timing/extent of conservative/delayed surgery in the context of fertility preservation is undetermined.
- Clinical utility of CA125 and NSE as markers in this case needs correlation with imaging and course.

- Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour, predominantly dysgerminoma with ~10% mature teratoma; high Ki‑67 and classic dysgerminoma IHC; no yolk sac component.
- Fertility-sparing right adnexectomy performed; current treatment is first‑line/adjuvant post-surgery with 2 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
- AFP has normalized (<2); CA125 mildly elevated; β‑hCG and LDH not yet documented.
- MRI shows a 1.8 cm solid nodule on the surface of the left ovary, suspicious for implantation but decreasing in size; small pelvic effusion present.
- No PET/FAPI or full whole‑abdomen staging imaging available; extra‑pelvic disease status unknown.

Controversies:
- Unclear whether the original operation was a full staging procedure, so FIGO stage is uncertain.
- Nature of the left ovarian surface lesion (regressing active disease vs residual teratoma vs postoperative/inflammatory change) remains unresolved.
- Best balance between further systemic therapy and timing/extent of conservative/delayed surgery in the context of fertility preservation is undetermined.
- Clinical utility of CA125 and NSE as markers in this case needs correlation with imaging and course.

Missing Info:
- Complete operative and pathology staging details (tumour size, capsule/surface involvement, omentum/peritoneal biopsies, nodes, washings, margins, final FIGO stage).
- Full histopathology including teratoma maturity and any extraovarian disease in original specimens.
- Up‑to‑date cross‑sectional imaging (pelvis/abdomen ± chest) fully characterizing the 1.8 cm nodule and any peritoneal/implant sites.
- PET‑CT/FAPI‑PET results or confirmation if/when planned.
- Serial tumour marker panel (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) with dates.
- Current organ function and toxicity profile post‑BEP (renal, pulmonary, marrow, ototoxicity) plus clearly documented fertility goals.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review full operative and pathology reports to define FIGO stage and completeness of staging.
- Arrange comprehensive updated imaging (CT/MRI pelvis–abdomen ± chest) and metabolic imaging (PET/FAPI) if available, to reassess the left ovarian lesion and rule out further disease.
- Plan ongoing systemic therapy within a first‑line/adjuvant context, aligned with fertility-sparing intent and potential timing of delayed conservative surgery.
- Implement standardized, scheduled tumour marker monitoring (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) and integrate with imaging for response and follow‑up assessment.

[R1T1 DELTA] , washings, margins, FIGO stage) so we can judge whether the left ovarian nodule represents possible implantation versus benign/secondary change. | pathologist->radiologist(missing): Given mixed germ cell histology with normalized AFP but uncertain stage, we need detailed re-evaluation of the left ovarian surface nodule (size trend, enhancement, diffusion, relation to cortex and peritoneum) and any peritoneal/omental implants on current cross-sectional imaging. | nuclear->oncologist(missing): Metabolic characterization of the left ovarian surface nodule is still completely absent; please confirm if PET/FAPI is planned and timing relative to ongoing chemotherapy. | nuclear->radiologist(missing): Given the unresolved 1.8 cm left ovarian surface lesion and unknown extra‑pelvic status, please advise on optimal timing and modality for PET/FAPI integration with planned cross‑sectional imaging.
[R1T2 DELTA] oncologist->chair(safety): Systemic-therapy planning remains constrained by uncertain FIGO stage, uncharacterized left ovarian surface lesion, and absent organ-function/toxicity data; further chemotherapy beyond two cycles should be deferred until pathology, imaging, and fertility goals are clarified. | radiologist->nuclear(missing): From an imaging workflow perspective, pairing PET/FAPI with the next contrast-enhanced CT or MRI abdomen–pelvis once the current chemotherapy cycle is completed (or just before major surgical decisions) would best characterize the 1.8 cm left ovarian surface lesion and detect extra‑pelvic disease in a single staging timepoint.

  **Assistant:** Key Knowledge:
- Mixed ovarian germ cell tumour, predominantly dysgerminoma with ~10% mature teratoma; high Ki‑67; no yolk sac component on IHC.
- Fertility-sparing right adnexectomy; patient currently in first‑line/adjuvant setting after 2 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
- AFP has normalized (<2); CA125 mildly elevated; β‑hCG and LDH not yet reported.
- MRI: 1.8 cm solid nodule on the surface of the left ovary, suspicious for implantation but decreasing in size; small pelvic effusion.
- No PET/FAPI or full whole‑abdomen/chest staging imaging; extra‑pelvic disease status unknown.

Controversies:
- Extent and intent of initial surgery (full staging vs limited fertility-sparing) unclear; FIGO stage remains uncertain.
- Biological nature of the left ovarian surface nodule (implant vs residual teratoma vs postoperative/inflammatory change) unresolved.
- Appropriate balance and sequencing of further chemotherapy versus timing/extent of conservative/delayed surgery under fertility-sparing goals.
- Utility of CA125 and NSE as reliable disease markers in this case remains uncertain.

Missing Info:
- Full operative and pathology staging details (tumour size, capsule/surface involvement, omentum/peritoneal biopsies, nodal sampling, washings, margins, FIGO stage).
- Detailed histopathology including teratoma maturity and any extraovarian disease in original specimens.
- Updated cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI pelvis–abdomen ± chest) with full characterization of the 1.8 cm nodule (trend, enhancement, diffusion, relationship to cortex/peritoneum) and any peritoneal/omental implants.
- PET‑CT/FAPI‑PET status: whether planned, timing relative to chemotherapy, and optimal integration with CT/MRI for single staging timepoint.
- Serial tumour marker trends (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) with dates.
- Current organ function/toxicity after BEP (renal, pulmonary, marrow, ototoxicity) and clearly documented fertility-preservation priorities.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review complete operative and pathology reports to define FIGO stage and staging completeness, including potential for implantation to the left ovary.
- Request detailed re-evaluation/report of current imaging focusing on the left ovarian surface nodule and any peritoneal/omental disease; arrange updated CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis ± chest.
- Coordinate with nuclear medicine and radiology to schedule PET/FAPI at the same time as next contrast-enhanced CT/MRI (post-current chemo cycle or pre-major surgery) for metabolic characterization and global staging.
- Clarify systemic-therapy strategy within a first-line/adjuvant framework once staging, toxicity profile, and fertility goals are available.
- Implement standardized serial tumour marker monitoring (AFP, β‑hCG, LDH, CA125, NSE) and integrate with imaging for response and surveillance planning.
