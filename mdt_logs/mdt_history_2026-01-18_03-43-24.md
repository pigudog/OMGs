## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
- If intolerable toxicity or ECOG ≥3, then adjust management from active systemic therapy to symptom‑focused best supportive care.  
- If clear radiologic progression or CA125 doubling, then adjust management from current regimen to next‑line systemic or trial strategy.  
- If significant response (tumor shrinkage, CA125 fall, symptoms improved), then adjust management from induction intensity to maintenance‑intensity systemic therapy.  
- If new organ dysfunction from metastases (e.g., liver failure, bowel obstruction), then adjust management from standard dosing to modified, palliative‑priority strategy.  
- If actionable biomarker emerges on repeat profiling, then adjust management from empiric chemotherapy to targeted/biomarker‑guided systemic approach.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Confirm performance status, symptoms, patient goals; discuss palliative vs disease-directed intent given progressive presacral and liver metastases [@2022-12-29|MR;2022-12-29|CT].  
- Treat as platinum‑resistant recurrent clear cell ovarian cancer; plan non‑platinum systemic therapy and consider clinical trial enrollment.  
- Address severe anemia urgently (Hgb 74 g/L) with cause evaluation and correction before or during further systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- No actionable HRD/BRCA found; consider broader molecular profiling of recurrent tissue if feasible to identify additional targets [@OH2203828].  
- Clarify current performance status, comorbidities, pain control, prior toxicities, and any maintenance therapies given, before finalizing regimen and sequencing.
```


## oncologist

```
- Biochemical and radiologic relapse within ~2 months of completing platinum suggests platinum-resistant recurrent clear cell ovarian carcinoma.  

- Current disease is metastatic (pelvis, liver); systemic therapy now palliative/relapse setting rather than adjuvant. [@20221229|9703212; 2022-12-30 imaging per case view]  

- Organ function appears adequate for systemic therapy; hepatic and renal parameters acceptable. [@20221229|8300002]  

- Significant anemia (HGB 74 g/L) requires evaluation and correction before or during next-line systemic treatment. [@20230103|5600862]  

- Missing/needs update today: ECOG performance status, current symptoms, full staging scan reports, prior regimen tolerability, and patient treatment goals/preferences.
```


## radiologist

```
- Enlarging 5.3×4.4 cm presacral postoperative mass with heterogeneous enhancement, suspicious for local pelvic recurrence and sacral involvement [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- Multiple enhancing pelvic mesenteric nodules, overall similar/slightly increased, consistent with peritoneal/mesenteric metastases [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- New enhancing nodule in right iliac bone, suspicious for osseous metastasis [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- Multiple hepatic metastatic nodules increased in number and size versus October, indicating progressive liver metastases [@2022-12-29|CT].  

- New focal splenic low-density area possibly infarct; recommend clinical correlation and imaging follow-up [@2022-12-29|CT].
```


## pathologist

```
- Current diagnosis: recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma involving rectosigmoid, left retroperitoneum, and vagina; high‑grade adenocarcinoma morphology [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2022-03-28].  

- IHC supports MMR proficiency (MLH1/MSH2/MSH6/PMS2 all retained), excluding overt MMR-deficient phenotype [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2022-03-28].  

- Clear cell phenotype corroborated by HNF1B+, focal Napsin A+, PAX8+, WT1–, ER/PR low, Ki‑67 ~60% [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2022-03-28].  

- Germline ATM p.Y316C detected; HRD negative; no pathogenic BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA variants [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  

- Missing: updated stage at recurrence, contemporary imaging, MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 results on recurrent tumor, and any newer molecular profiling.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT available; metabolic pattern, current stage by PET, and PET evidence of recurrence are unknown/need update.  

- Prior MR shows enlarging presacral mass with sacral and peritoneal involvement, highly suspicious for local recurrent pelvic disease [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- Pelvic mesenteric nodules and right iliac bone nodule suggest additional metastatic sites beyond local presacral recurrence [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- CT demonstrates multiple progressive liver metastases, confirming distant metastatic spread and at least M1 disease [@2022-12-29|CT].  

- A new whole-body FDG PET/CT is needed now to clarify full metastatic burden and guide current staging.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Platinum‑resistant recurrent high‑grade ovarian clear cell carcinoma with rapid post‑platinum relapse and widespread metastases (presacral with probable sacral involvement, peritoneal/mesenteric, liver, possible bone).  
- Pathology: clear cell phenotype; MMR‑proficient, HRD‑negative, no BRCA1/2 or clear targetable alterations; germline ATM p.Y316C (VUS).  
- Management intent is palliative; current organ function seems adequate for further systemic therapy.  
- Severe anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires urgent investigation and correction.  

Controversies:
- Optimal choice and sequencing of non‑platinum systemic therapy in platinum‑resistant clear cell disease under palliative intent.  
- Whether additional molecular profiling on recent recurrent tissue (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1, expanded NGS) will meaningfully expand systemic or trial options.  
- Whether PET/CT (vs optimized CT/MRI) would materially change management or trial eligibility in this context.  

Missing Info:
- ECOG performance status, symptom burden, pain control, comorbidities, and patient goals/preferences.  
- Detailed history of prior systemic and maintenance therapies, responses, and toxicities.  
- Up‑to‑date comprehensive imaging (including chest and spine) and formal restaging; confirmation that no interim PET/CT exists.  
- Full anemia work‑up and broader labs (iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, coagulation, nutrition).  
- MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 status and any NGS performed on the most recent recurrent tumor sample; feasibility and turnaround for new testing.  

Working Plan:
- First clarify ECOG, symptom burden, and patient priorities to guide the balance between disease‑directed therapy and supportive care.  
- Evaluate and treat severe anemia in parallel with planning, including diagnostic work‑up for cause.  
- Define a non‑platinum systemic approach appropriate for platinum‑resistant clear cell carcinoma and assess clinical trial eligibility once PS and goals are known.  
- Determine feasibility and utility of updated molecular profiling (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 and NGS on recurrent tissue) to broaden options.  
- From imaging side, confirm availability/quality of recent chest/spine CT/MRI; consider whole‑body PET/CT or comprehensive CT restaging only if findings are likely to alter systemic or trial decisions.
[R2T1 DELTA] oncologist->chair(safety): Before committing to further systemic therapy or PET/CT, we must urgently clarify ECOG, symptom burden, goals, and correct the severe anemia. | oncologist->pathologist(unspecified): Given platinum-resistant, biomarker-negative clear cell disease, please confirm if recurrent-tissue MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and expanded NGS are feasible with acceptable turnaround. | oncologist->radiologist(unspecified): Please confirm whether any recent chest/spine imaging exists; if absent, advise whether comprehensive CT versus PET/CT would better support treatment/trial decisions. | oncologist->nuclear(unspecified): In this widely metastatic, palliative setting, would PET/CT provide management-changing information beyond optimized CT/MRI for systemic or trial planning?
[R2T2 DELTA] radiologist->oncologist(missing): No chest or spine imaging is documented after 2022-12 CT/MR abdomen/pelvis; a contrast-enhanced chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with targeted spine evaluation should suffice for restaging unless a specific trial mandates PET/CT. | pathologist->oncologist(unspecified): From pathology side, MSI/MMR proteins are intact; MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and expanded NGS on recurrent tissue are not yet documented and feasibility/turnaround will depend on confirming an adequate recent block (tumor content, fixation) with the originating lab. | nuclear->oncologist(missing): In this widely metastatic, palliative setting, PET/CT is most useful if it would alter trial eligibility or focal radiotherapy plans; otherwise optimized contrast CT/MRI is usually sufficient for systemic decision-making.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **oncologist → chair:** Severe anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) needs urgent work‑up and correction before or alongside any new systemic regimen planning.
- **oncologist → radiologist:** Please confirm extent of presacral/sacral, hepatic, peritoneal, and possible bone involvement and whether additional chest or spine imaging is recommended now.
- **oncologist → pathologist:** Do we have any MSI/MMR, TMB, or PD‑L1 results from recurrent tissue, or is new biopsy/molecular profiling feasible?
- **oncologist → nuclear:** Would PET/CT materially refine staging or trial eligibility in this widely metastatic, platinum‑resistant setting, or add little beyond CT/MRI?
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Latest available imaging is from 2022-12-29/30 and already shows clear systemic progression; updated whole-body restaging (incl. chest and bone assessment) is needed to guide current palliative planning and pain risk assessment.
- **pathologist → chair:** Key pathology-based biomarkers (MMR, HRD, BRCA1/2) are already available, but absence of MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and recurrent-tissue NGS may limit systemic and trial planning; confirming whether additional sampling/testing is practical in this platinum-resistant, palliative context is important for MDT decisions.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** MMR proficiency and HRD-negative status are established, but MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and any NGS on recurrent tissue remain undocumented; if further systemic options or trial eligibility are being considered, updated molecular profiling on the most recent tumor should be obtained if feasible.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** No PET/CT has been performed yet; if trial eligibility or precise metastatic mapping is relevant, a whole-body FDG PET/CT is still needed.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** From nuclear perspective, current staging relies only on MR/CT; please confirm if any interim PET/CT or chest imaging exists or is scheduled.

#### Turn 2
- **oncologist → chair:** Given platinum-resistant clear cell histology and palliative intent, we should prioritize clarifying ECOG, symptoms, and goals before committing to further systemic therapy or PET/CT.
- **oncologist → radiologist:** Before considering PET/CT, can you confirm availability and adequacy of recent chest and spine imaging to document pulmonary and bone status?
- **oncologist → pathologist:** Agree MMR/HRD/BRCA are done; please advise on feasibility and expected turnaround for MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and updated NGS on the most recent tumor sample.
- **oncologist → nuclear:** If adequate CT/MRI chest/abdomen/pelvis and spine can be obtained, would PET/CT meaningfully alter systemic or trial decisions in this case?
- **radiologist → nuclear:** No PET/CT or recent dedicated chest imaging is documented; from radiology side, updated whole-body CT or PET/CT restaging is advisable if management may change.

### Round 2

#### Turn 1
- **oncologist → chair:** Before committing to further systemic therapy or PET/CT, we must urgently clarify ECOG, symptom burden, goals, and correct the severe anemia.
- **oncologist → radiologist:** Please confirm whether any recent chest/spine imaging exists; if absent, advise whether comprehensive CT versus PET/CT would better support treatment/trial decisions.
- **oncologist → pathologist:** Given platinum-resistant, biomarker-negative clear cell disease, please confirm if recurrent-tissue MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and expanded NGS are feasible with acceptable turnaround.
- **oncologist → nuclear:** In this widely metastatic, palliative setting, would PET/CT provide management-changing information beyond optimized CT/MRI for systemic or trial planning?

#### Turn 2
- **radiologist → oncologist:** No chest or spine imaging is documented after 2022-12 CT/MR abdomen/pelvis; a contrast-enhanced chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with targeted spine evaluation should suffice for restaging unless a specific trial mandates PET/CT.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** From pathology side, MSI/MMR proteins are intact; MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and expanded NGS on recurrent tissue are not yet documented and feasibility/turnaround will depend on confirming an adequate recent block (tumor content, fixation) with the originating lab.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** In this widely metastatic, palliative setting, PET/CT is most useful if it would alter trial eligibility or focal radiotherapy plans; otherwise optimized contrast CT/MRI is usually sufficient for systemic decision-making.

- Platinum‑resistant recurrent high‑grade ovarian clear cell carcinoma with rapid post‑platinum relapse and widespread metastases (presacral with probable sacral involvement, peritoneal/mesenteric, liver, possible bone).  
- Pathology: clear cell phenotype; MMR‑proficient, HRD‑negative, no BRCA1/2 or clear targetable alterations; germline ATM p.Y316C (VUS).  
- Management intent is palliative; current organ function seems adequate for further systemic therapy.  
- Severe anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires urgent investigation and correction.  

Controversies:
- Optimal choice and sequencing of non‑platinum systemic therapy in platinum‑resistant clear cell disease under palliative intent.  
- Whether additional molecular profiling on recent recurrent tissue (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1, expanded NGS) will meaningfully expand systemic or trial options.  
- Whether PET/CT (vs optimized CT/MRI) would materially change management or trial eligibility in this context.  

Missing Info:
- ECOG performance status, symptom burden, pain control, comorbidities, and patient goals/preferences.  
- Detailed history of prior systemic and maintenance therapies, responses, and toxicities.  
- Up‑to‑date comprehensive imaging (including chest and spine) and formal restaging; confirmation that no interim PET/CT exists.  
- Full anemia work‑up and broader labs (iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, coagulation, nutrition).  
- MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 status and any NGS performed on the most recent recurrent tumor sample; feasibility and turnaround for new testing.  

Working Plan:
- First clarify ECOG, symptom burden, and patient priorities to guide the balance between disease‑directed therapy and supportive care.  
- Evaluate and treat severe anemia in parallel with planning, including diagnostic work‑up for cause.  
- Define a non‑platinum systemic approach appropriate for platinum‑resistant clear cell carcinoma and assess clinical trial eligibility once PS and goals are known.  
- Determine feasibility and utility of updated molecular profiling (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 and NGS on recurrent tissue) to broaden options.  
- From imaging side, confirm availability/quality of recent chest/spine CT/MRI; consider whole‑body PET/CT or comprehensive CT restaging only if findings are likely to alter systemic or trial decisions.
[R2T1 DELTA] oncologist->chair(safety): Before committing to further systemic therapy or PET/CT, we must urgently clarify ECOG, symptom burden, goals, and correct the severe anemia. | oncologist->pathologist(unspecified): Given platinum-resistant, biomarker-negative clear cell disease, please confirm if recurrent-tissue MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and expanded NGS are feasible with acceptable turnaround. | oncologist->radiologist(unspecified): Please confirm whether any recent chest/spine imaging exists; if absent, advise whether comprehensive CT versus PET/CT would better support treatment/trial decisions. | oncologist->nuclear(unspecified): In this widely metastatic, palliative setting, would PET/CT provide management-changing information beyond optimized CT/MRI for systemic or trial planning?
[R2T2 DELTA] radiologist->oncologist(missing): No chest or spine imaging is documented after 2022-12 CT/MR abdomen/pelvis; a contrast-enhanced chest/abdomen/pelvis CT with targeted spine evaluation should suffice for restaging unless a specific trial mandates PET/CT. | pathologist->oncologist(unspecified): From pathology side, MSI/MMR proteins are intact; MSI/TMB/PD-L1 and expanded NGS on recurrent tissue are not yet documented and feasibility/turnaround will depend on confirming an adequate recent block (tumor content, fixation) with the originating lab. | nuclear->oncologist(missing): In this widely metastatic, palliative setting, PET/CT is most useful if it would alter trial eligibility or focal radiotherapy plans; otherwise optimized contrast CT/MRI is usually sufficient for systemic decision-making.

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Platinum‑resistant recurrent high‑grade ovarian clear cell carcinoma with rapid post‑platinum relapse and widespread metastases (presacral with probable sacral involvement, peritoneal/mesenteric, liver, possible bone).  
- Pathology: clear cell phenotype; MMR‑proficient, HRD‑negative, no BRCA1/2 or clear targetable alterations; germline ATM p.Y316C (VUS).  
- Management intent is palliative; current organ function seems adequate for further systemic therapy.  
- Severe anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires urgent investigation and correction.  

Controversies:
- Optimal choice and sequencing of non‑platinum systemic therapy in platinum‑resistant clear cell disease under palliative intent.  
- Whether additional molecular profiling on recent recurrent tissue (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1, expanded NGS) will meaningfully expand systemic or trial options.  
- Whether PET/CT (vs optimized CT/MRI) would materially change management or trial eligibility in this context.  

Missing Info:
- ECOG performance status, symptom burden, pain control, comorbidities, and patient goals/preferences.  
- Detailed history of prior systemic and maintenance therapies, responses, and toxicities.  
- Up‑to‑date comprehensive imaging (including chest and spine) and formal restaging; confirmation that no interim PET/CT exists.  
- Full anemia work‑up and broader labs (iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, coagulation, nutrition).  
- MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 status and any NGS performed on the most recent recurrent tumor sample; feasibility and turnaround for new testing.  

Working Plan:
- First clarify ECOG, symptom burden, and patient priorities to guide the balance between disease‑directed therapy and supportive care.  
- Evaluate and treat severe anemia in parallel with planning, including diagnostic work‑up for cause.  
- Define a non‑platinum systemic approach appropriate for platinum‑resistant clear cell carcinoma and assess clinical trial eligibility once PS and goals are known.  
- Determine feasibility and utility of updated molecular profiling (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 and NGS on recurrent tissue) to broaden options.  
- From imaging side, confirm availability/quality of recent chest/spine CT/MRI; consider whole‑body PET/CT or comprehensive CT restaging only if findings are likely to alter systemic or trial decisions.

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Platinum‑resistant recurrent high‑grade ovarian clear cell carcinoma with rapid post‑platinum relapse and widespread metastases (presacral with probable sacral involvement, peritoneal/mesenteric, liver, possible bone).  
- Pathology: clear cell phenotype; MMR‑proficient, HRD‑negative, no BRCA1/2 or clear targetable alterations; germline ATM p.Y316C (VUS).  
- Management intent is palliative; current organ function seems adequate for further systemic therapy.  
- Severe anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires urgent investigation and correction.  

Controversies:
- Optimal choice and sequencing of non‑platinum systemic therapy in platinum‑resistant clear cell disease under palliative intent.  
- Whether additional molecular profiling on recent recurrent tissue (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1, expanded NGS) will meaningfully expand systemic or trial options.  
- Whether PET/CT (vs optimized CT/MRI) would materially change management or trial eligibility in this context.  

Missing Info:

- Full anemia work‑up and broader labs (iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, coagulation, nutrition).  
- MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 status and any NGS performed on the most recent recurrent tumor sample; feasibility and turnaround for new testing.  

Working Plan:
- First clarify ECOG, symptom burden, and patient priorities to guide the balance between disease‑directed therapy and supportive care.  
- Evaluate and treat severe anemia in parallel with planning, including diagnostic work‑up for cause.  
- Define a non‑platinum systemic approach appropriate for platinum‑resistant clear cell carcinoma and assess clinical trial eligibility once PS and goals are known.  
- Determine feasibility and utility of updated molecular profiling (MSI/TMB/PD‑L1 and NGS on recurrent tissue) to broaden options.
