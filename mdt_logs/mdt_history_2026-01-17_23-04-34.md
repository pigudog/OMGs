## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Metastatic Krukenberg-type mucinous/signet carcinoma with brain and extensive peritoneal/ureteral involvement is in a palliative, systemically untreated state, with primary site, fitness for further therapy, and current renal function still uncertain [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-12-20; @IMAGING_TRENDS|2025-02-10; @IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-01-20].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Conduct structured goals-of-care visit documenting ECOG, symptom burden, and preferences for further active versus comfort-focused care (currently unknown).  
- Obtain updated labs including creatinine/eGFR and urine output assessment, with nephrology/urology review to define ongoing obstruction and treatment feasibility (unknown).  
- Arrange contrast-enhanced CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis and repeat brain MRI to reassess peritoneal, nodal, ureteral, and CNS disease before systemic decisions [@IMAGING_TRENDS|2025-02-10; @IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-01-20].  
- Confirm paraffin block availability and perform extended IHC only if primary-site clarification would realistically modify systemic regimen category (availability/status unknown).  

Change Triggers:
- If ECOG ≤2, renal function acceptable, and patient desires treatment, shift from evaluation-only to offering palliative systemic and CNS-directed therapy.  
- If ECOG ≥3, progressive renal failure, or patient prefers comfort-focused care, pivot from active oncologic interventions to best supportive and hospice care.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Widely metastatic Krukenberg-type mucinous/signet tumor with brain and extensive peritoneal disease; prognosis poor, intent palliative systemic and local control.  
- Urgent clarification of prior systemic therapy and platinum exposure (agents, cycles, dates, responses) is essential before choosing next-line regimen.  
- Given brain metastasis, prioritize multidisciplinary neuro-oncology/rad-onc review for local treatment plus CNS-penetrant systemic strategy, if feasible.  
- Renal function remains impaired (Cr ~110–170 µmol/L); nephrology input to optimize drainage, stents/nephrostomy, and chemotherapy dosing constraints.  
- Confirm updated staging imaging, performance status, symptoms, and patient goals/preferences to balance active treatment versus early palliative-focused pathway.
```


## oncologist

```
- Metastatic Krukenberg tumor with brain involvement; systemic therapy now palliative/relapse setting rather than curative.  

- Renal function significantly impaired but improving; precise current creatinine, eGFR, and trend needed to choose/regimen-dose systemic therapy.  

- No prior systemic therapy lines documented; must confirm any previous chemotherapy, dates, toxicities, and response.  

- Biomarkers: HER2-, MSS, low TMB, HRD/BRCA wildtype—targeted/maintenance options limited; PD-L1, CA125, AFP levels unknown/need update.  

- Need up-to-date brain and systemic imaging, performance status, and current medications to judge fitness for combination vs less intensive therapy.
```


## radiologist

```
- Progressive diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis with omental/mesenteric nodularity and increasing ascites, indicating worsening intra-abdominal disease burden [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-02-10].  

- Retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy consistent with nodal metastases; appears increased compared with earlier CT description [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-02-10].  

- Bilateral ureteral thickening concerning for potential evolving ureteral obstruction; renal collecting system status unknown/needs update [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-02-10].  

- Small pleural and peritoneal effusions persist, suggesting ongoing serosal involvement; no large pleural masses described [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-01-28].  

- Solitary or limited cerebral sulcal metastasis on brain MRI; no trend or hemorrhage information available/needs update [@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-01-20].
```


## pathologist

```
- Morphology favors metastatic Krukenberg tumor with mixed mucinous and signet-ring cell features; primary gastrointestinal origin still unconfirmed.  

- Extensive involvement of uterine wall, ureter, diaphragm, and lymph nodes indicates widely metastatic disease burden [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-12-20].  

- ER/PR negative; no HER2 (ERBB2) amplification, MSS, low TMB, HRD/BRCA wildtype limit certain targeted biomarker options [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-12-20].  

- Somatic FBXW7 R505C mutation present; clinical significance here uncertain and should be correlated with GI versus ovarian primary [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-12-20].  

- Missing/needs update: detailed primary-site workup reports (upper/lower endoscopy, breast imaging), CA125/AFP, PD-L1 CPS, full panel IHC profile.
```


## nuclear

```
- Prior PET/CT showed multiple abdominal and pelvic metastases, consistent with disseminated peritoneal and nodal involvement (advanced stage pattern). [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|Unknown]  

- Subsequent imaging demonstrates cerebral sulcal metastasis, indicating distant metastatic spread beyond peritoneal cavity. [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|2025-01-20]  

- Progressive widespread peritoneal and nodal disease with ascites suggests high whole-abdomen tumor burden. [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|2025-01-28] [@IMAGING_CONTEXT|2025-02-10]  

- No current PET/CT report available for this visit; updated whole-body PET/CT report is needed to reassess metabolic disease extent.  

- PET would meaningfully refine staging/recurrence suspicion by clarifying active peritoneal, nodal, and distant (e.g., brain) metabolic disease distribution.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Widely metastatic Krukenberg-type mucinous/signet tumor with extensive peritoneal, nodal, and brain disease; prognosis poor, management palliative.
- Pattern favors metastatic GI primary; ER/PR-, HER2-, MSS, low TMB, HRD/BRCA WT → limited targeted/maintenance options.
- Imaging shows progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis, nodal progression, ascites, small serosal effusions, and cerebral sulcal metastasis.
- Renal function impaired with probable obstructive component (bilateral ureteral thickening), constraining systemic therapy dosing/choice.

Controversies:
- Primary site (GI vs other) remains unproven; extended IHC may refine origin and influence systemic strategy.
- Benefit of PET/CT in a clearly palliative, widely metastatic setting versus CT/MRI alone, and whether results would change management.
- Optimal CNS approach (local vs combined with CNS-penetrant systemic therapy) pending updated imaging and specialist review.

Missing Info:
- Full prior systemic therapy details (agents, cycles, dates, response, toxicities, platinum exposure).
- Current renal function (creatinine, eGFR, trend), degree of obstruction, and urology/nephrology assessment.
- Updated brain MRI and systemic imaging (including contrast CT/MRI for ureteral/obstruction assessment), ECOG PS, symptoms, and medications.
- Primary-site workup: availability of tissue/blocks for extended IHC (CDX2, SATB2, CK7/20, PAX8, MUC), plus endoscopy/breast imaging, CA125, AFP, PD-L1 CPS.
- Decision on and, if chosen, results of any whole-body PET/CT with full head coverage and MRI coregistration.

Working Plan:
- Verify prior systemic therapy history and update labs (especially renal) and performance status to frame feasible palliative systemic options.
- Confirm tissue/block availability and request extended IHC to better define primary site if results would influence systemic decision-making.
- Arrange neuro-oncology/radiation MDT review for brain metastasis and consider CNS-penetrant systemic strategy where appropriate.
- Obtain nephrology/urology input on obstructive uropathy, drainage optimization, and chemotherapy dosing limits; repeat contrast-enhanced CT/MRI to reassess obstruction.
- Decide if PET/CT would meaningfully alter management before ordering; if done, ensure full head coverage and fusion with latest brain MRI.
- Proceed with structured goals-of-care and palliative planning discussions aligned with prognosis and patient preferences.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before committing to any systemic regimen, we must first document exact prior chemotherapy exposure, current ECOG, and up-to-date renal function/eGFR, given recent obstructive AKI and nephrostomy/stents.
- **chair → radiologist:** Please propose an imaging plan (timing and modalities) to reassess brain metastasis and systemic disease, considering prior CT/MRI and potential PET/CT utility.
- **chair → pathologist:** Can you clarify, based on existing histology/IHC and genomics, how strongly a GI primary is supported and what additional stains/tests would most efficiently refine the primary-site diagnosis?
- **chair → nuclear:** From your perspective, would a whole-body PET/CT meaningfully change management in this patient with known widespread peritoneal and brain metastases, or should we prioritize conventional CT/MRI only?
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic regimen choice is currently unsafe to finalize because prior systemic therapies, detailed renal function, and ECOG status are all undocumented and critical for dosing/feasibility.
- **radiologist → chair:** Key staging images are over 7 weeks old; updated cross-sectional and brain imaging are needed to guide current palliative planning.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Before further systemic decisions, updated CT/MRI (chest/abdomen/pelvis and brain) is critical to reassess obstruction, peritoneal burden, and CNS disease extent.
- **pathologist → chair:** Pathology workup for primary site is incomplete; please confirm whether additional tissue or outside blocks are available for extended IHC to refine primary assignment.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** Primary remains unproven (GI vs other); extended IHC panel (CDX2, SATB2, CK7/20, PAX8, MUC markers) on available tissue would better define origin and may influence systemic choices.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** No recent PET/CT is available; if prognosis and goals permit, a single whole-body PET/CT could clarify current metabolic burden versus CT alone, especially extra-abdominal disease and brain involvement correlation.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** If PET/CT is pursued, please ensure brain-included acquisition and tight coregistration with latest MRI to assess metabolic activity of sulcal lesions and any additional CNS foci.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Before ordering PET/CT, we should clarify how its results would practically alter systemic or CNS management in a patient already deemed palliative with extensive disease.
- **chair → pathologist:** Please confirm availability of existing tissue/blocks and feasibility of extended IHC now, as primary-site assignment may materially affect systemic strategy discussions.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Given prior CT evidence of bilateral ureteral thickening and worsening peritoneal disease, updated contrast-enhanced CT (or MRI) is important to reassess obstruction risk and guide palliative interventions.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** If PET/CT is obtained, please include full head coverage and ensure fusion with the most recent brain MRI for accurate CNS assessment.

```


## pathologist

```
- Confirm if existing paraffin blocks/slides are available and suitable for extended IHC to refine GI vs ovarian primary (unknown/needs update).  

- If tissue available, perform targeted IHC panel (CK7/CK20, CDX2, SATB2, PAX8, MUCs) to better assign primary (unknown/needs update).

```


## nuclear

```
- No recent PET/CT is available; its value should be weighed against limited likelihood of management change in this palliative setting.

- PET/CT may help distinguish metabolically active peritoneal/nodal deposits from treated or non-malignant changes, but impact on systemic choices remains uncertain.  

- PET/CT would not define the primary site; that depends on extended IHC and GI/breast workup (status unknown/needs update).  

- Coordination with updated brain MRI and contrast-enhanced CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis is essential for accurate fusion and obstruction/CNS risk assessment; timing unknown.
```

## nuclear

```
- No recent PET/CT available; current metabolic disease extent and activity remain unknown/needs update.  

- In this extensively metastatic, palliative setting, PET/CT should be ordered only if results are expected to change management.  

- If performed, whole-body PET/CT with full head coverage and MRI fusion could better delineate active CNS and extra-abdominal disease.  

- PET/CT may help differentiate active peritoneal/nodal disease from treated or non-malignant changes, but staging is already clearly metastatic.  

- PET/CT will not clarify primary origin; this depends on extended IHC and other site-directed investigations (status unknown/needs update).

  **Assistant:** Final Assessment:
Metastatic Krukenberg-type mucinous/signet carcinoma with brain and extensive peritoneal/ureteral involvement is in a palliative, systemically untreated state, with primary site, fitness for further therapy, and current renal function still uncertain [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2024-12-20; @IMAGING_TRENDS|2025-02-10; @IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-01-20].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Conduct structured goals-of-care visit documenting ECOG, symptom burden, and preferences for further active versus comfort-focused care (currently unknown).  
- Obtain updated labs including creatinine/eGFR and urine output assessment, with nephrology/urology review to define ongoing obstruction and treatment feasibility (unknown).  
- Arrange contrast-enhanced CT/MRI abdomen–pelvis and repeat brain MRI to reassess peritoneal, nodal, ureteral, and CNS disease before systemic decisions [@IMAGING_TRENDS|2025-02-10; @IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-01-20].  
- Confirm paraffin block availability and perform extended IHC only if primary-site clarification would realistically modify systemic regimen category (availability/status unknown).  

Change Triggers:
- If ECOG ≤2, renal function acceptable, and patient desires treatment, shift from evaluation-only to offering palliative systemic and CNS-directed therapy.  
- If ECOG ≥3, progressive renal failure, or patient prefers comfort-focused care, pivot from active oncologic interventions to best supportive and hospice care.

- Pattern favors metastatic GI primary; ER/PR-, HER2-, MSS, low TMB, HRD/BRCA WT → limited targeted/maintenance options.
- Imaging shows progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis, nodal progression, ascites, small serosal effusions, and cerebral sulcal metastasis.
- Renal function impaired with probable obstructive component (bilateral ureteral thickening), constraining systemic therapy dosing/choice.

Controversies:
- Primary site (GI vs other) remains unproven; extended IHC may refine origin and influence systemic strategy.
- Benefit of PET/CT in a clearly palliative, widely metastatic setting versus CT/MRI alone, and whether results would change management.
- Optimal CNS approach (local vs combined with CNS-penetrant systemic therapy) pending updated imaging and specialist review.

Missing Info:
- Full prior systemic therapy details (agents, cycles, dates, response, toxicities, platinum exposure).
- Current renal function (creatinine, eGFR, trend), degree of obstruction, and urology/nephrology assessment.
- Updated brain MRI and systemic imaging (including contrast CT/MRI for ureteral/obstruction assessment), ECOG PS, symptoms, and medications.
- Primary-site workup: availability of tissue/blocks for extended IHC (CDX2, SATB2, CK7/20, PAX8, MUC), plus endoscopy/breast imaging, CA125, AFP, PD-L1 CPS.
- Decision on and, if chosen, results of any whole-body PET/CT with full head coverage and MRI coregistration.

Working Plan:
- Verify prior systemic therapy history and update labs (especially renal) and performance status to frame feasible palliative systemic options.
- Confirm tissue/block availability and request extended IHC to better define primary site if results would influence systemic decision-making.
- Arrange neuro-oncology/radiation MDT review for brain metastasis and consider CNS-penetrant systemic strategy where appropriate.
- Obtain nephrology/urology input on obstructive uropathy, drainage optimization, and chemotherapy dosing limits; repeat contrast-enhanced CT/MRI to reassess obstruction.
- Decide if PET/CT would meaningfully alter management before ordering; if done, ensure full head coverage and fusion with latest brain MRI.
- Proceed with structured goals-of-care and palliative planning discussions aligned with prognosis and patient preferences.

  **Assistant:** - No recent PET/CT available; current metabolic disease extent and activity remain unknown/needs update.  

- In this extensively metastatic, palliative setting, PET/CT should be ordered only if results are expected to change management.  

- If performed, whole-body PET/CT with full head coverage and MRI fusion could better delineate active CNS and extra-abdominal disease.  

- PET/CT may help differentiate active peritoneal/nodal disease from treated or non-malignant changes, but staging is already clearly metastatic.  

- PET/CT will not clarify primary origin; this depends on extended IHC and other site-directed investigations (status unknown/needs update).
