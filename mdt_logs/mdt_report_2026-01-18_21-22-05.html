      <pre>Final Assessment:
Systemic recurrent pelvic malignancy with hepatic and osseous metastases and severe anemia, but tumor origin, prior therapy, and current extent remain insufficiently defined for safe systemic treatment decisions. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT] [@20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Defer new systemic regimen and trial enrollment until full pathology, prior oncologic treatments, and performance status are clarified. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11]  
- Obtain and review complete pathology (primary and any metastases, including IHC, grade, stage) to define tumor origin and subtype. unknown/needs update  
- Arrange updated CT/MR and consider PET/CT to restage, assess obstruction/neurologic risk, and confirm current metastatic burden. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT] [@pubmed:35296733]  
- Urgently evaluate and manage anemia/lymphopenia (workup, transfusion as indicated) before any myelosuppressive therapy. [@20230103|5600862]

Change Triggers:
- If pathology confirms epithelial ovarian origin, align with epithelial ovarian systemic pathways, considering limited PARP role in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11] [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]  
- If updated imaging or symptoms reveal obstruction, neurologic compromise, or fracture risk, prioritize urgent local/palliative interventions before systemic therapy. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT]</pre>

    Systemic anti-cancer treatment in malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs): current management and promising approaches.
    Malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs) are rare. Unlike epithelial ovarian cancer, MOGCTs typically occur in girls and young women. Fertility-sparing surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy remain the standard of care, providing high chance of cure at all stages. Given the lack of high-quality…

    Significance of platinum distribution to predict platinum resistance in ovarian cancer after platinum treatment in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
    Most patients with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and develop resistance to platinum-based agents. The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spe…

    How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.
    About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD m…

    Disparity in the era of personalized medicine for epithelial ovarian cancer.
    The treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer has seen significant improvements in recent years, with BRCA1/2 and homologous recombination status guiding a personalized approach which has resulted in improved patient outcomes. However, for other epithel…

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Systemic anti-cancer treatment in malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs): current management and promising approaches.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Malignant ovarian germ cell tumours (MOGCTs) are rare. Unlike epithelial ovarian cancer, MOGCTs typically occur in girls and young women. Fertility-sparing surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy remain the standard of care, providing high chance of cure at all stages. Given the lack of high-quality studies in this field, current practice guidelines recommend chemotherapy regimens adopted in testicular germ cell tumours. However, platinum-resistant/refractory MOGCTs retain a worse prognosis in comparison with their male counterpart. Herein, we focus on current systemic anti-cancer treatment options in MOGCTs and promising approaches. Future studies enrolling exclusively female participants or germ cell tumour trials allowing participation of MOGCT patients are strongly recommended in order to improve evidence on existing management and develop novel strategies.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Significance of platinum distribution to predict platinum resistance in ovarian cancer after platinum treatment in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Most patients with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and develop resistance to platinum-based agents. The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to visualize the platinum distribution in the ovarian cancer tissues at the time of interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 27patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Two distinct patterns of platinum distribution were observed. Type A (n = 16): platinum accumulation at the adjacent stroma but little in the tumor; type B (n = 11): even distribution of platinum throughout the tumor and adjacent stroma. The type A patients treated post-surgery with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly shorter periods of recurrence after the last platinum-based chemotherapy session (p = 0.020) and were diagnosed with \&quot;platinum-resistant recurrence\&quot;. Moreover, type A was significantly correlated with worse prognosis (p = 0.031). Post-surgery treatment with non-platinum-based chemotherapy could be effective for the patients classified as type A. Our findings indicate that the platinum resistance can be predicted prior to recurrence, based on the platinum distribution; this could contribute to the selection of more appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, which may lead to improves prognoses.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD mutational status profoundly affect first line chemotherapy as well as response to maintenance therapy with PARP-i, hence Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Consequently, there is urgent need for the development of increasingly reliable HRD tests, overcoming present limitations, as they play a key role in the diagnostic and therapeutic process as well as have a prognostic and predictive value. In this review we offer an overview of the state of the art regarding the actual knowledge about BRCA and HRD mutational status, the rationale of PARPi use and HRD testing (current and in development assays) and their implications in clinical practice and in the treatment decision process, in order to optimize and choose the best tailored therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Disparity in the era of personalized medicine for epithelial ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;The treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer has seen significant improvements in recent years, with BRCA1/2 and homologous recombination status guiding a personalized approach which has resulted in improved patient outcomes. However, for other epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes, first-line treatment remains unchanged from the platinum-paclitaxel trials of the early 2000s. In this review, we explore novel therapeutic approaches being adopted in the treatment of clear cell, mucinous, carcinosarcoma and low-grade serous ovarian cancer and the biological rational behind them. We discuss why such disparities exist, the challenges faced in conducting dedicated trials in these rarer histologies and look towards new approaches being adopted to overcome them.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer is not a single disease and can be subdivided into at least five different histological subtypes that have different identifiable risk factors, cells of origin, molecular compositions, clinical features and treatments. Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.&quot;,

    <pre>- For malignant ovarian germ cell tumors, standard management is fertility-sparing surgery when feasible plus platinum-based chemotherapy, which achieves high cure rates across stages; treatment intensification beyond platinum-based regimens is generally reserved for refractory or relapsed disease. [@pubmed:33490225]

- In epithelial ovarian cancer, most patients eventually recur with platinum resistance; platinum-free interval is an imperfect surrogate, and emerging approaches (e.g., tissue platinum distribution assessment) may better predict resistance and guide timing of non-platinum strategies or trials. [@pubmed:35296733]

- BRCA1/2 mutation and broader homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status should be obtained early in the treatment course because they are key determinants of benefit from PARP inhibitor maintenance and influence overall therapeutic planning in high-grade serous and related histologies. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11] [@pubmed:38525421]

- Personalized approaches and access to biomarker-driven therapies (e.g., PARP inhibitors for BRCA/HRD-positive disease) are not uniform across populations; MDTs should consider referral pathways and trial enrollment to mitigate disparities in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer care.
