      <h2>Final MDT Output</h2>
      <pre>Final Assessment:
Widely metastatic presumed gynecologic malignancy with liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease and severe anemia; primary histology, prior treatments, and current stage/line remain uncertain, so only diagnostic and supportive steps are appropriate today [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @20230103|5600862].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently retrieve all prior surgical/biopsy pathology and reports to establish primary site, histologic subtype, grade, and stage; currently unknown.  
- If prior pathology unobtainable, plan image‑guided biopsy of an accessible metastatic lesion after restaging to secure diagnosis and IHC.  
- Arrange updated whole‑body staging (contrast CT/MR ± FDG PET/CT) to reassess liver, presacral, bone, peritoneal, and rectal involvement before therapy [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].  
- Optimize severe anemia with full work‑up and supportive treatment to ensure future systemic‑therapy fitness; repeat CBC and chemistries for baseline [@20230103|5600862].  

Change Triggers:
- If pathology confirms epithelial ovarian primary and imaging shows widespread metastatic disease, MDT to define systemic treatment intent and palliative focus [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- If restaging reveals complications (obstruction, impending fracture, spinal/pelvic instability), prioritize urgent surgical/radiation/palliative interventions before systemic therapy planning.</pre>

  &quot;chair&quot;: &quot;- Advanced recurrent ovarian malignancy with progressive pelvic mass, pelvic bone lesion, and liver metastases on recent imaging [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  \n- HRD-/BRCA‑wildtype; systemic therapy plan should not assume PARP benefit outside trial; consider standard chemotherapy-based approach [@OH2203828].  \n- Profound anemia (HGB 74 g/L) likely requires optimization and transfusion planning before intensive systemic therapy [@20230103|2023-01-03].  \n- Tumor markers very elevated (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3); can be used for response monitoring, not for standalone decisions [@20221229|9703212].  \n- Missing: current histology/grade, prior surgery/chemo details, performance status, symptoms, patient goals—must be updated before definitive systemic/locoregional plan.&quot;,
  &quot;oncologist&quot;: &quot;- Tumor type, stage, prior surgery/chemotherapy, and current disease status are unknown/needs update to define treatment line and intent.  \n\n- Markedly elevated CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3 and ROMA suggest ovarian malignancy, but histology/pathology report is unknown/needs update [@20221229|9703212].  \n\n- HRD negative and no BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants; this limits certain maintenance options after platinum response [@OH2203828|2022-04-18; @guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|18].  \n\n- Significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires evaluation of cause and correction before or during systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  \n\n- Renal and hepatic function appear adequate for most systemic options, but full current labs and trends are unknown/needs update [@20221229|8300002].&quot;,
  &quot;radiologist&quot;: &quot;- Presacral pelvic mass enlarged to 53×44 mm with heterogeneous signal and involvement of adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, suspicious recurrence.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- New enhancing nodule in right ilium, concerning for osseous metastasis.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Multiple enhancing mesenteric/pelvic nodules unchanged, compatible with peritoneal metastases.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Focal rectal wall thickening with enhancement; needs correlation for invasion versus inflammatory change.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Liver with multiple new/enlarging hypodense lesions, consistent with progressive hepatic metastases; additional stable hepatic cysts and possible splenic infarct.[@2022-12-29|CT]&quot;,
  &quot;pathologist&quot;: &quot;- Only confirmed finding: germline ATM exon8 c.A947G:p.Y316C variant; clinical significance not specified in report [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n- HRD reported negative; no pathogenic germline/somatic BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, BARD1 detected [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n- Underlying tumor type, primary site, histologic subtype, grade, and stage are completely unknown/need update.  \n- No tumor tissue NGS, MSI/MMR, TMB, or other somatic profiling data available/needs update for integrated pathology assessment.  \n- Need full surgical pathology report(s) and any IHC panels to clarify diagnosis and guide biomarker interpretation.&quot;,
  &quot;nuclear&quot;: &quot;- No PET/CT or other nuclear imaging available for this visit; metabolic status of pelvic, hepatic, bone lesions unknown/needs update.  \n\n- Prior MR pelvis shows enlarging presacral mass with sacrum, peritoneum, right ilium involvement; recurrence/metastasis structurally suspected [@2022-12-29|MR].  \n\n- Prior CT abdomen shows multiple enlarging hepatic lesions consistent with metastases; PET would better characterize whole-body disease burden [@2022-12-29|CT].  \n\n- For current decision-making, a whole-body FDG PET/CT is needed to assess metabolic activity and refine staging/recurrence mapping.  \n\n- Cannot yet determine if PET would upstage or downstage compared with prior MR/CT; requires new PET/CT acquisition and report.&quot;

    Histopathologic image-based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.
    Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. The…

    How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.
    About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD m…

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer is not a single disease and can be subdivided into at least five different histological subtypes that have different identifiable risk factors, cells of origin, molecular compositions, clinical features and treatments. Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Histopathologic image-based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image-based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n = 394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n = 284 and n = 136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model&#x27;s decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD mutational status profoundly affect first line chemotherapy as well as response to maintenance therapy with PARP-i, hence Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Consequently, there is urgent need for the development of increasingly reliable HRD tests, overcoming present limitations, as they play a key role in the diagnostic and therapeutic process as well as have a prognostic and predictive value. In this review we offer an overview of the state of the art regarding the actual knowledge about BRCA and HRD mutational status, the rationale of PARPi use and HRD testing (current and in development assays) and their implications in clinical practice and in the treatment decision process, in order to optimize and choose the best tailored therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Disparity in the era of personalized medicine for epithelial ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;The treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and high-grade endometrioid ovarian cancer has seen significant improvements in recent years, with BRCA1/2 and homologous recombination status guiding a personalized approach which has resulted in improved patient outcomes. However, for other epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes, first-line treatment remains unchanged from the platinum-paclitaxel trials of the early 2000s. In this review, we explore novel therapeutic approaches being adopted in the treatment of clear cell, mucinous, carcinosarcoma and low-grade serous ovarian cancer and the biological rational behind them. We discuss why such disparities exist, the challenges faced in conducting dedicated trials in these rarer histologies and look towards new approaches being adopted to overcome them.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;c-MYC and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of gynecological malignancies with approximately 49% of women surviving 5 years after initial diagnosis. The standard of care for ovarian cancer consists of cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Unfortunately, despite initial response, platinum resistance remains a major clinical challenge. Therefore, the identification of effective biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial to guide therapy regimen, maximize clinical benefit, and improve patient outcome. Given the pivotal role of c-MYC deregulation in most tumor types, including ovarian cancer, assessment of c-MYC biological and clinical relevance is essential. Here, we briefly describe the frequency of c-MYC deregulation in ovarian cancer and the consequences of its targeting.&quot;,

    <h3>Digest (<=8 bullets)</h3>
    <pre>- NCCN recommends primary treatment of newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer with cytoreductive surgery plus platinum-based combination chemotherapy; extent/timing of surgery (primary vs interval debulking) should be individualized in a multidisciplinary setting [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].  
- For stage I–II epithelial ovarian cancers, NCCN advises comprehensive surgical staging (including peritoneal washings, omentectomy, peritoneal biopsies, and lymph node assessment) to guide adjuvant therapy decisions [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (typically carboplatin plus paclitaxel) is standard for most stage II–IV epithelial ovarian cancers and for selected high‑risk stage I disease based on histology and grade [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- NCCN recommends universal germline BRCA1/2 testing and somatic tumor HRD/BRCA testing in epithelial ovarian cancer, as these results direct use of PARP inhibitor maintenance and other targeted strategies [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|18; @pubmed:38525421].  
- PARP inhibitor maintenance (alone or combined with bevacizumab, depending on prior therapy and biomarker status) is recommended after response to first‑line platinum-based chemotherapy in BRCA‑mutated and/or HRD‑positive high‑grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancers [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|18; @pubmed:38525421].  
- For fertility preservation, ESGO/ESHRE/ESGE guidelines outline indications for in vivo ovarian tissue preservation and fertility‑sparing surgery based on histologic subtype and FIGO stage; these approaches are generally restricted to early-stage, low‑risk tumors and require specialized counseling [@guideline:esgo_eshre_esge_fertilitysparing_pocket_2025__v00000000|17].  
- NCCN emphasizes that treatment choice should account for histologic subtype (e.g., high‑grade serous vs clear cell vs low‑grade serous), as biology and chemosensitivity differ, and some subtypes may benefit from tailored systemic or hormonal approaches [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|15; @pubmed:27558151].  
- Disparities in access to biomarker testing and PARP inhibitors significantly impact outcomes; MDTs should ensure timely testing, genetic counseling, and equitable access to targeted therapies when indicated [@pubmed:36643655].</pre>
