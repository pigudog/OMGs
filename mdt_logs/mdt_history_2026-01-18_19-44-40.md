## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive pelvic, hepatic, and iliac bone disease and significant cytopenias; primary histology, prior treatments, and goals of care remain undefined, so only diagnostic and supportive steps are appropriate today. [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently retrieve all pathology, operative notes, and full oncology records to define diagnosis, prior lines, and treatment intent (unknown/needs update).  
- Arrange focused workup and management of anemia/lymphopenia, including transfusion needs, before any cytotoxic or intensive therapy. [@20230103|5600862]  
- Document detailed performance status and symptom burden to guide feasibility of systemic, radiotherapy, or best-supportive-care–dominant strategies. (unknown/needs update)  
- Consider updated cross-sectional imaging and PET/FDG only if, after diagnosis/intent clarification, results would change systemic vs palliative/RT planning. [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14]

Change Triggers:
- If pathology and prior treatment history confirm a specific gynecologic primary and line of therapy, reconvene MDT to select systemic/RT approach.  
- If performance status or cytopenias prove poor or non-correctable, shift emphasis toward symptom-directed palliative care over disease-directed intensification.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive liver and bone metastases; clarify primary site, histology, and prior treatments before systemic strategy.  

- Marked anemia and lymphopenia; urgently evaluate etiology, bleeding, iron/B12/folate, hemolysis, and performance status before intensive therapy. [@20230103|2023-01-03]  

- HRD negative, BRCA wild-type; consider non‑PARP systemic/locoregional options once pathology, stage, symptoms, and goals of care are updated. [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]
```


## oncologist

```
- Diagnosis, stage, prior systemic therapy line, and treatment intent are all unknown/needs update before any regimen choice.  

- Current labs show significant anemia with preserved platelets and renal/liver function, affecting intensity and timing of systemic therapy [@20221229|8300002][@20230103|5600862].  

- Germline testing: HRD negative, no pathogenic BRCA1/2 or other listed DNA-repair mutations; influences maintenance/targeted strategy selection [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].
```


## radiologist

```
- Liver: multiple low-density metastases, increased number and size versus 2022-10-24; largest ~17×14 mm. [@2022-10-24|CT][@2022-12-29|CT]

- Pelvis: presacral mass ~53×44 mm with heterogeneous enhancement, involving adjacent peritoneum and sacrum; pelvic mesenteric nodules. [@2022-12-29|MR]

- New right iliac bone enhancing lesion suggesting osseous metastasis; rectal wall thickening/enhancement may indicate local invasion. [@2022-12-29|MR]
```


## pathologist

```
- No histology, grade, or IHC available; need primary pathology report and any subsequent biopsies for definitive diagnosis/grading (unknown/needs update).

- Molecular: germline ATM exon8 c.A947G:p.Y316C variant; HRD, BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, BARD1 all negative [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].

- Somatic tumor sequencing, HRD status on tumor tissue, and current stage/site of disease not documented; require updated tumor NGS/IHC reports (unknown/needs update).
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/FDG study available; metabolic pattern, staging impact, and recurrence assessment are currently unknown/needs update.

- Cross‑sectional imaging shows progressive multifocal hepatic lesions, highly suspicious for metastases, but without metabolic characterization [@2022-10-24|CT][@2022-12-29|CT].

- Pelvic MR shows enlarging presacral mass with adjacent bone/peritoneal involvement, compatible with local recurrence and metastasis, pending PET correlation [@2022-12-29|MR].
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with enlarging presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum and likely rectal wall.
- Progressive metastases: increasing liver lesions and new right iliac bone lesion.
- Marked anemia and lymphopenia; platelets and renal/hepatic function relatively preserved.
- HRD negative, BRCA wild-type; germline ATM variant of uncertain significance; no HRD/BRCA-based options.
- Staging based on CT/MR only; no PET/FDG performed.
- Key management decisions are currently being considered without a confirmed tissue diagnosis.

Controversies:
- Primary site, histologic subtype, and grade remain undefined; true origin of pelvic malignancy unclear.
- Treatment intent and prior systemic therapy lines unknown, limiting systemic and local strategy planning.
- Appropriateness and timing of systemic vs palliative/locoregional interventions in context of cytopenias and metastatic burden remain uncertain.
- Whether PET/FDG would meaningfully alter management or radiotherapy planning is not yet established.

Missing Info:
- Pathology: original and metastatic biopsy reports, full IHC panel, and tumor grade.
- Oncologic history: initial stage, prior surgery/radiation/systemic therapies, responses, toxicities, and current symptoms/performance status.
- Hematologic workup for anemia/lymphopenia.
- Tumor-level molecular profiling (somatic NGS, tumor HRD, predictive markers).
- PET/FDG or equivalent whole-body functional imaging for comprehensive staging.

Working Plan:
- Prioritize retrieval and review of all pathology (primary and metastatic), operative notes, and oncology treatment records before further MDT decision-making.
- Defer selection of a specific systemic regimen and any local/ablative procedures until diagnosis, primary tumor type, and treatment intent are clarified.
- Complete workup of anemia and lymphopenia and document current performance status and symptom burden.
- Consider whole-body PET/FDG, with dedicated pelvic and hepatic assessment, if results are expected to change systemic strategy or radiotherapy planning.
- Reconvene MDT to reassess systemic and locoregional/palliative options once diagnosis, staging, biomarkers, and goals of care are defined.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before proposing any new systemic plan today, please first clarify prior systemic lines, responses, and current performance status given marked anemia/lymphopenia and progressive metastases.
- **chair → pathologist:** We urgently need full pathology (primary and any recurrent/metastatic biopsies with IHC/grade) to define tumor type before further treatment decisions.
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic regimen choice today is unsafe without knowing primary histology, prior systemic lines, and current performance status; these must be clarified before committing to further cytotoxic or targeted therapy in the setting of marked anemia and progressive metastatic disease.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Imaging demonstrates progressive multifocal liver metastases and enlarging presacral mass with probable sacral and rectal involvement; this suggests advancing systemic and locoregional disease burden needing correlation with current symptoms and performance status.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** CT/MR show progressive liver, presacral, and new right iliac bone lesions; PET/FDG could refine whole-body staging and detect additional metastases if consistent with goals of care.
- **pathologist → chair:** Key management decisions are being discussed without any confirmed tissue diagnosis; MDT planning should be deferred until pathology reports are obtained and reviewed.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** Primary histology, IHC panel, and grade remain completely undocumented; please prioritize retrieving original and metastatic biopsy pathology for diagnostic clarification.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** No PET/FDG has been done; given multifocal liver, pelvic, and bone disease, whole‑body PET could refine current staging and recurrence assessment if results would change management or radiotherapy planning.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** If PET/FDG is obtained, please ensure dedicated pelvic and hepatic assessment to better characterize presacral, hepatic, and iliac bone lesions and detect additional disease.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Given the absence of any documented tissue diagnosis or prior systemic history, please avoid committing to a specific systemic regimen today and focus on organizing pathology retrieval and anemia/lymphopenia workup.
- **chair → radiologist:** Further local or ablative procedures should not be planned until pathology and oncologic history clarify primary tumor type and intent of care.

Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive pelvic, hepatic, and iliac bone disease and significant cytopenias; primary histology, prior treatments, and goals of care remain undefined, so only diagnostic and supportive steps are appropriate today. [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently retrieve all pathology, operative notes, and full oncology records to define diagnosis, prior lines, and treatment intent (unknown/needs update).  
- Arrange focused workup and management of anemia/lymphopenia, including transfusion needs, before any cytotoxic or intensive therapy. [@20230103|5600862]  
- Document detailed performance status and symptom burden to guide feasibility of systemic, radiotherapy, or best-supportive-care–dominant strategies. (unknown/needs update)  
- Consider updated cross-sectional imaging and PET/FDG only if, after diagnosis/intent clarification, results would change systemic vs palliative/RT planning. [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14]

Change Triggers:
- If pathology and prior treatment history confirm a specific gynecologic primary and line of therapy, reconvene MDT to select systemic/RT approach.  
- If performance status or cytopenias prove poor or non-correctable, shift emphasis toward symptom-directed palliative care over disease-directed intensification.

- **User:** Given MDT context:
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with enlarging presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum and likely rectal wall.
- Progressive metastases: increasing liver lesions and new right iliac bone lesion.
- Marked anemia and lymphopenia; platelets and renal/hepatic function relatively preserved.
- HRD negative, BRCA wild-type; germline ATM variant of uncertain significance; no HRD/BRCA-based options.
- Staging based on CT/MR only; no PET/FDG performed.
- Key management decisions are currently being considered without a confirmed tissue diagnosis.

Controversies:
- Primary site, histologic subtype, and grade remain undefined; true origin of pelvic malignancy unclear.
- Treatment intent and prior systemic therapy lines unknown, limiting systemic and local strategy planning.
- Appropriateness and timing of systemic vs palliative/locoregional interventions in context of cytopenias and metastatic burden remain uncertain.
- Whether PET/FDG would meaningfully alter management or radiotherapy planning is not yet established.

Missing Info:
- Pathology: original and metastatic biopsy reports, full IHC panel, and tumor grade.
- Oncologic history: initial stage, prior surgery/radiation/systemic therapies, responses, toxicities, and current symptoms/performance status.
- Hematologic workup for anemia/lymphopenia.
- Tumor-level molecular profiling (somatic NGS, tumor HRD, predictive markers).
- PET/FDG or equivalent whole-body functional imaging for comprehensive staging.

Working Plan:
- Prioritize retrieval and review of all pathology (primary and metastatic), operative notes, and oncology treatment records before further MDT decision-making.
- Defer selection of a specific systemic regimen and any local/ablative procedures until diagnosis, primary tumor type, and treatment intent are clarified.
- Complete workup of anemia and lymphopenia and document current performance status and symptom burden.
- Consider whole-body PET/FDG, with dedicated pelvic and hepatic assessment, if results are expected to change systemic strategy or radiotherapy planning.
- Reconvene MDT to reassess systemic and locoregional/palliative options once diagnosis, staging, biomarkers, and goals of care are defined.

- Oncologic history: initial stage, prior surgery/radiation/systemic therapies, responses, toxicities, and current symptoms/performance status.
- Hematologic workup for anemia/lymphopenia.
- Tumor-level molecular profiling (somatic NGS, tumor HRD, predictive markers).
- PET/FDG or equivalent whole-body functional imaging for comprehensive staging.

Working Plan:
- Prioritize retrieval and review of all pathology (primary and metastatic), operative notes, and oncology treatment records before further MDT decision-making.
- Defer selection of a specific systemic regimen and any local/ablative procedures until diagnosis, primary tumor type, and treatment intent are clarified.
- Complete workup of anemia and lymphopenia and document current performance status and symptom burden.
- Consider whole-body PET/FDG, with dedicated pelvic and hepatic assessment, if results are expected to change systemic strategy or radiotherapy planning.
- Reconvene MDT to reassess systemic and locoregional/palliative options once diagnosis, staging, biomarkers, and goals of care are defined.
