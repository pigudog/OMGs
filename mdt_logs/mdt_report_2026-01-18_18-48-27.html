      <h2>Final MDT Output</h2>
      <pre>Final Assessment:
Metastatic recurrent malignancy with progressive liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease and severe anemia; primary site, histology, stage, prior treatments, and current performance status remain undefined [@2022-12-29|CT][@2022-12-29|MR][@20230103|5600862].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently repeat CBC, full anemia workup, and assess for transfusion/bleeding to stabilize before biopsy/systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Retrieve all prior pathology/IHC and full oncologic treatment records to define primary site, histology, and treatment line (currently unknown).  
- Arrange whole-body FDG PET/CT coordinated with image-guided biopsy of safest liver lesion for updated pathology and molecular profiling [@2022-12-29|CT].  
- After pathology and staging clarification, reconvene MDT to choose non‑HRD‑oriented systemic category and symptom‑directed local palliation [@OH2203828|2022-04-18][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  

Change Triggers:
- If anemia remains unstable or symptomatic despite optimization, defer invasive biopsy/systemic therapy and prioritize stabilization and supportive care.  
- If new tissue/IHC shows non‑gynecologic or unexpected primary, shift from gynecologic pathway to site‑specific systemic and palliative strategy.</pre>

  &quot;chair&quot;: &quot;- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive presacral mass, bone and liver metastases; high CA125, CA19‑9 elevation [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@20221229|9703212].  \n- Significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) likely multifactorial; urgently clarify symptoms, hemodynamics, and need for transfusion before systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  \n- Liver and renal function currently acceptable for systemic treatment; continue to monitor closely during any therapy [@20221229|8300002].  \n- HRD/BRCA negative; consider non‑HRD–focused systemic strategies and clinical trials rather than PARP‑driven approaches [@OH2203828][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|15].  \n- Missing: current histology/stage, prior treatments, performance status, pain/neurologic status, patient goals; obtain before definitive systemic vs local palliation plan.&quot;,
  &quot;oncologist&quot;: &quot;- Diagnosis, disease stage, prior systemic treatments, and current disease status are unknown/needs update to define treatment intent and line.  \n\n- HRD-negative, BRCA1/2 wild-type; germline ATM variant; implications for PARP/DDR-targeted strategies limited [@report_id:OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n\n- Anemia (Hgb 74 g/L, RBC 2.84×10¹²/L) may constrain myelosuppressive regimens; etiology and transfusion/iron status need update [@20230103|2023-01-03].  \n\n- Renal and hepatic function appear adequate for most systemic therapies; confirm current values and trend before new regimen [@20221229|2022-12-29].  \n\n- Tumor markers markedly elevated (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3); need imaging and pathology update to correlate with disease burden [@20221229|2022-12-29].&quot;,
  &quot;radiologist&quot;: &quot;- Presacral pelvic mass at vaginal stump, now 53×44 mm with heterogeneous enhancement, invading adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, consistent with local recurrence. [@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Multiple enhancing nodules in pelvic mesentery unchanged from prior, suspicious for peritoneal metastatic disease. [@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- New enhancing nodule in right iliac bone, suspicious for osseous metastasis. [@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Liver with multiple metastatic nodules, increased number and size versus October 2022; coexisting stable hepatic cysts. [@2022-12-29|CT]\n\n- Splenic patchy low-density area possibly infarct; recommend correlation with symptoms and follow-up imaging. [@2022-12-29|CT]&quot;,
  &quot;pathologist&quot;: &quot;- No histology or IHC reports are available; tumor type, primary site, and grade remain completely undefined (needs surgical pathology report).  \n- Germline ATM exon8 c.A947G p.Y316C variant reported; clinical significance for this case not specified [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n- HRD testing reported negative; BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, BARD1 show no pathogenic variants detected [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  \n- Somatic tumor sequencing results are not documented; updated tumor NGS/HRR panel from most recent tissue, if done, is needed.  \n- Correlation of this germline panel with a specific malignancy is impossible without updated pathology diagnosis and staging information.&quot;,
  &quot;nuclear&quot;: &quot;- No PET/CT available; metabolic characterization of liver, pelvic, and bone lesions currently impossible—FDG PET/CT needed for staging update.  \n\n- CT shows multiple enlarging liver low-density nodules, radiologically consistent with progressive hepatic metastases, not yet metabolically confirmed [@2022-12-29|CT].  \n\n- Pelvic MRI indicates enlarging presacral mass with peritoneal and sacral involvement, suspicious for local recurrence and invasion [@2022-12-29|MR].  \n\n- MRI also shows new enhancing right iliac bone lesion and mesenteric nodules, suspicious for osseous and peritoneal metastases [@2022-12-29|MR].  \n\n- Need current whole-body FDG PET/CT to assess metabolic activity, confirm recurrence extent, and potentially upstage with additional distant lesions.&quot;

    How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.
    About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD m…

    Histopathologic image-based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.
    Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. The…

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer is not a single disease and can be subdivided into at least five different histological subtypes that have different identifiable risk factors, cells of origin, molecular compositions, clinical features and treatments. Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD mutational status profoundly affect first line chemotherapy as well as response to maintenance therapy with PARP-i, hence Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Consequently, there is urgent need for the development of increasingly reliable HRD tests, overcoming present limitations, as they play a key role in the diagnostic and therapeutic process as well as have a prognostic and predictive value. In this review we offer an overview of the state of the art regarding the actual knowledge about BRCA and HRD mutational status, the rationale of PARPi use and HRD testing (current and in development assays) and their implications in clinical practice and in the treatment decision process, in order to optimize and choose the best tailored therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Histopathologic image-based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image-based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n = 394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n = 284 and n = 136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model&#x27;s decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Olaparib as maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors were developed with the intention of treating patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), specifically for patients with tumours that harbour a BRCA mutation (BRCAm). Evidence from clinical trials to date has demonstrated that patients with a BRCAm derive the greatest benefit from PARP inhibitors. However, clinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors provide benefit to women with ovarian cancer who do not have a BRCAm. The recent updated approvals of olaparib, niraparib and rucaparib by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of all platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian-cancer populations, regardless of their BRCAm status, support this. Long-term tolerability and efficacy of olaparib have been demonstrated in patients both with and without a BRCAm, with 13% of patients receiving maintenance olaparib for at least 5 years in one study, which is unprecedented in the relapsed ovarian-cancer setting (versus 1% on placebo). Further studies should be performed to elucidate which non-BRCAm patients are deriving benefit and what molecular processes are enabling this, so that patients continue to receive optimal treatment for their disease. Here, we review clinical and molecular markers of HRD, the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer, with a focus on olaparib and the current approved indications for PARP inhibitors, as well as guidance on treatment decisions for patients with PSR ovarian cancer.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Olaparib and advanced ovarian cancer: Summary of the past and looking into the future.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer (OC) is women&#x27;s eighth most common cancer, bearing the highest mortality rates of all female reproductive system malignancies. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) have reshaped the treatment scenario of metastatic OC as a maintenance post platinum-based chemotherapy. Olaparib is the first PARPi developed for this disease. Results from Study 42, Study 19, SOLO2, OPINION, SOLO1, and PAOLA-1 clinical trials, led to the FDA and EMA approval of olaparib for the maintenance treatment of women with high-grade epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer without platinum progression: in the platinum-sensitive recurrent OC; in the newly diagnosed setting in case Breast Cancer (BRCA) mutations and, in combination with bevacizumab, in case of BRCA mutation or deficiency of homologous recombination genes. In this review, we synthetized olaparib&#x27;s pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and its use in special populations. We summarized the efficacy and safety of the studies leading to the current approvals and discussed the future developments of this agent.&quot;,

    <pre>- Validated molecular testing on the most recent tumor tissue in a CLIA-approved lab is recommended, at minimum including tests for BRCA1/2 and other homologous recombination repair/HRD markers to guide systemic therapy choices such as PARP inhibitors [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|15].  
- Definitions of platinum-sensitive vs platinum-resistant recurrence exist on a continuum; treatment selection (including consideration of platinum rechallenge vs non-platinum options and maintenance strategies) should incorporate clinical judgment rather than rigid interval cutoffs [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- Systemic therapy selection and management of infusion or drug-related reactions should follow established NCCN “Principles of Systemic Therapy” and “Management of Drug Reactions,” including premedication and desensitization approaches when appropriate [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- For fertility-sparing management, ovarian tissue preservation is stage- and histology-dependent; epithelial vs non-epithelial tumors and borderline vs invasive subtypes have different indications and contraindications for in vivo tissue preservation [@guideline:esgo_eshre_esge_fertilitysparing_pocket_2025__v00000000|17].  
- High-grade serous ovarian cancer comprises multiple molecularly distinct entities; histologic subtype should be confirmed because it influences prognosis, patterns of spread, and responsiveness to platinum and targeted therapies [@pubmed:27558151].  
- Approximately 50% of high-grade serous tumors show HRD; BRCA-mutated and HRD-positive disease derive the greatest benefit from PARP inhibitors, informing both primary and recurrent treatment strategies [@pubmed:38525421].  
- In platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, maintenance olaparib after response to platinum chemotherapy significantly prolongs progression-free survival, particularly in BRCA-mutated and HRD-positive populations, and is standard of care where available [@pubmed:31205507][@pubmed:37153769].  
- Emerging histopathology-based deep learning tools may help predict platinum responsiveness in high-grade serous ovarian cancer, but these remain investigational and are not yet standard for treatment selection [@pubmed:38762636].</pre>
