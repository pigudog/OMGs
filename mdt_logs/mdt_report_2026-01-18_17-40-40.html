      <h2>Final MDT Output</h2>
      <pre>Final Assessment:
Disseminated recurrent gynecologic malignancy with progressive pelvic, liver, and probable bone involvement in a non‑curative setting; histologic subtype, primary site, performance status, and anemia etiology remain unresolved. [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Maintain non‑curative, symptom‑focused intent and engage palliative care for pain, bowel/bladder, and liver/bone symptom management.  
- Urgently evaluate severe anemia (iron/B12/folate, bleeding/hemolysis) and provide transfusion/supportive care before systemic therapy decisions. [@20230103|5600862]  
- Expedite retrieval/review of all pathology (initial and recurrence histology, IHC, staging) and full prior treatment history; currently unknown.  
- Defer new systemic treatment intensity and any radiotherapy planning until anemia work‑up, ECOG status, pathology clarification, and patient goals are documented.  

Change Triggers:
- If anemia stabilized and ECOG acceptable, then revisit suitability and goals of systemic therapy versus best supportive care focus.  
- If pathology/treatment history clarify primary site and subtype, then individualize systemic and radiotherapy strategies per disease biology and prior exposure.</pre>

  &quot;chair&quot;: &quot;- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive sacral, peritoneal, bone and liver metastases; intent should now be non-curative, symptom-focused. [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @2022-10-24|CT]\n\n- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires urgent evaluation, transfusion consideration and cause clarification before systemic therapy decisions. [@20230103|5600862]\n\n- Liver and renal function currently acceptable, permitting consideration of further systemic therapy if performance status and symptoms allow. [@20221229|8300002]\n\n- Germline HRD-negative, BRCA wild type with ATM variant; PARP benefit uncertain, prioritize conventional systemic options or trials. [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]\n\n- Critical missing data: histology/grade, initial stage, prior treatments and responses, current ECOG, symptoms, and patient preferences/goals.&quot;,
  &quot;oncologist&quot;: &quot;- Tumor markers CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3 markedly elevated, supporting active gynecologic malignancy; histologic diagnosis and stage unknown/needs update. [@20221229|9703212]\n\n- Severe anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) likely limits intensity of cytotoxic therapy; etiology and transfusion/iron status unknown/needs update. [@20230103|5600862]\n\n- Renal and hepatic function acceptable for most systemic agents, but full panel including electrolytes and eGFR confirmation needed. [@20221229|8300002]\n\n- HRD negative, BRCA1/2 negative, germline ATM variant identified; implications for targeted therapy modest. [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]\n\n- Missing: exact cancer diagnosis, prior systemic treatments, treatment response, performance status, current disease burden/imaging to define line and intent.&quot;,
  &quot;radiologist&quot;: &quot;- Presacral pelvic mass enlarged to ~53×44 mm with more heterogeneous signal; involves adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, suggesting progressive local recurrence.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Persistent thickened vaginal stump and enhancing rectal wall segment adjacent to mass, raising concern for direct local involvement.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- New enhancing nodule in right iliac bone, suspicious for osseous metastasis.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Multiple enhancing mesenteric/pelvic nodules unchanged, compatible with stable peritoneal metastatic disease.[@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- Liver: multiple metastatic lesions increased in number and size; additional stable hepatic cysts and possible splenic infarct needing follow‑up.[@2022-12-29|CT]&quot;,
  &quot;pathologist&quot;: &quot;- No histology, grade, site, or IHC results are available; primary diagnosis cannot be confirmed or classified.  \n- Germline ATM exon8 c.A947G:p.Y316C variant reported; clinical significance (pathogenic vs VUS) not specified. [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]  \n- HRD testing reported negative; BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, BARD1 pathogenic variants not detected. [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]  \n- Tumor somatic NGS panel, MSI/MMR, TMB, and PD-L1 status unknown/needs update.  \n- Full surgical pathology report (histotype, grade, stage, margins, residual disease) and IHC panel results unknown/needs update.&quot;,
  &quot;nuclear&quot;: &quot;- No prior PET/CT available; baseline metabolic characterization of pelvic, hepatic, and osseous lesions is unknown/needs PET-CT update.\n\n- MRI shows enlarging presacral mass with sacrum and peritoneal involvement, highly suspicious for local pelvic recurrence. [@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- New right iliac bone enhancing lesion on MRI suggests possible osseous metastasis; PET could confirm metabolic activity and extent. [@2022-12-29|MR]\n\n- CT shows multiple increasing liver lesions consistent with metastases; PET may refine lesion count and confirm active disease burden. [@2022-12-29|CT]\n\n- PET/CT now would help refine staging (visceral and bone metastases vs localized recurrence) and guide future management planning.&quot;

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Update on the secondary cytoreduction in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer: a narrative review.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;The ovarian cancer recurrence occurs in 75% of patients with advanced FIGO stage, and its treatment is a challenge for the oncologist in gynecology. The standard treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) usually includes intravenous chemotherapy according to platinum sensitivity. Furthermore, maintenance treatment with target therapies [e.g., anti-angiogenic drug or PARP inhibitors (PARPi)], should be provided if not precedently administrated. In this scenario, secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) remains a practical but controversial option for platinum-sensitive ROC (PSROC). So far, several retrospective series and a Cochrane meta-analysis had concluded that SCS could determine better survival outcomes in ROC with favorable prognostic characteristics, such as the presence of a single anatomical site of recurrence, or when patients are accurately selected for surgery based on complete resection&#x27;s predictive models. Recently, three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigated the role of SCS in PSROC patients selected with different criteria. All the three RCTs showed a significant statistical advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) in the SCS group, with an even more significant difference in patients with complete cytoreduction (about 7-month PFS increased). Data on overall survival (OS) are different in the two completed trials. The GOG213 study has documented a longer OS of PSROC patients who received chemotherapy alone compared to surgery plus chemotherapy. Contrarily, the DESKTOP III trial showed 7.7 months of increased OS in the surgery group vs. chemotherapy alone, with a more difference in the complete tumor cytoreduction (CTC) group (12 months). These RCTs thereby suggest that undergoing complete cytoreduction may not be the only key and that the disease biology may also matter. Few recent retrospective series investigated the role of SCS according to BRCA mutation status and the effect of SCS in patients receiving emerging PARPi. A consequence of the developments in SCS and knowledge of different molecular pathways influencing the recurrent disease is that the future research objective should be to individualize and personalize the surgical approach.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;How BRCA and homologous recombination deficiency change therapeutic strategies in ovarian cancer: a review of literature.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;About 50% of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer exhibit a high degree of genomic instability due to mutation of genes involved in Homologous Recombination (HRD) and such defect accounts for synthetic lethality mechanism of PARP inhibitors (PARP-i). Several clinical trials have shown how BRCA and HRD mutational status profoundly affect first line chemotherapy as well as response to maintenance therapy with PARP-i, hence Progression Free Survival and Overall Survival. Consequently, there is urgent need for the development of increasingly reliable HRD tests, overcoming present limitations, as they play a key role in the diagnostic and therapeutic process as well as have a prognostic and predictive value. In this review we offer an overview of the state of the art regarding the actual knowledge about BRCA and HRD mutational status, the rationale of PARPi use and HRD testing (current and in development assays) and their implications in clinical practice and in the treatment decision process, in order to optimize and choose the best tailored therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Olaparib as maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors were developed with the intention of treating patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), specifically for patients with tumours that harbour a BRCA mutation (BRCAm). Evidence from clinical trials to date has demonstrated that patients with a BRCAm derive the greatest benefit from PARP inhibitors. However, clinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors provide benefit to women with ovarian cancer who do not have a BRCAm. The recent updated approvals of olaparib, niraparib and rucaparib by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of all platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian-cancer populations, regardless of their BRCAm status, support this. Long-term tolerability and efficacy of olaparib have been demonstrated in patients both with and without a BRCAm, with 13% of patients receiving maintenance olaparib for at least 5 years in one study, which is unprecedented in the relapsed ovarian-cancer setting (versus 1% on placebo). Further studies should be performed to elucidate which non-BRCAm patients are deriving benefit and what molecular processes are enabling this, so that patients continue to receive optimal treatment for their disease. Here, we review clinical and molecular markers of HRD, the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer, with a focus on olaparib and the current approved indications for PARP inhibitors, as well as guidance on treatment decisions for patients with PSR ovarian cancer.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;The current role of secondary cytoreductive surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian cancer represents worldwide the second most frequent and the most fatal gynecological malignancy, with approximately two thirds of the patients presenting with advanced disease. Cytoreductive surgery, primary or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients. Despite the improvement in quality of cytoreductive surgery as well as development of novel drugs and chemotherapy regimens, still most women with ovarian cancer will ultimately develop recurrent disease and die of their disease. In contrast to the management of primary disease, the standard treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer remains a topic of debate. While platinum-based or second line systemic chemotherapy, depending on the time after last platinum treatment, is standard of care, the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery has been a controversial issue for the last decades. Potential outcome benefit must be also weighed against the risk of severe surgical morbidity, impairment of quality of life and costs. In platinum-resistant recurrent disease, i.e., relapse after less than 6 months from the last platinum-based chemotherapy for primary disease, secondary cytoreduction seems generally not to be indicated due to its aggressive biological behavior and the absence of effective systemic treatment. In this comprehensive review, the current role of cytoreductive surgery in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer is discussed thoroughly in view of the results of most recent randomized trials and a meta-analysis. There seems to be definitely a role for secondary cytoreductive surgery in selected patients with ovarian cancer recurrence in whom complete resection of macroscopic disease is feasible. However, its role should be continuously reviewed due to the changing systemic treatment of patients with ovarian cancer recurrence over time.&quot;,

    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Case Report: Niraparib as Maintenance Therapy in A Patient With Ovarian Carcinosarcoma.&quot;,
    &quot;abstract&quot;: &quot;Ovarian carcinosarcoma (OCS) is a rare, highly aggressive and rapidly progressing malignant tumor with an extremely poor prognosis. So far, due to the low incidence of OCS, there are no large-scale prospective studies exploring the standard care of OCS patients. There is no uniform and effective treatment for OCS. Within the development of precision medicine, targeted therapies (such as PARP inhibitors) have been widely used in epithelial ovarian cancer and various other solid tumors. Here, we report a BRCAwt patient with advanced OCS who experienced a second and a third cytoreductive surgery in June 2017 and October 2019 and has been on niraparib maintenance therapy for more than 20 months after receiving second-line and third-line chemotherapy.&quot;,

    <h3>Digest (<=8 bullets)</h3>
    <pre>- Definitions of platinum-sensitive vs platinum-resistant relapse are a spectrum; clinical judgment and flexibility are recommended when choosing recurrence treatment and maintenance strategies, including PARPi or bevacizumab use [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].

- In platinum-sensitive recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, treatment is generally guided by platinum sensitivity status, with secondary cytoreductive surgery plus platinum-based chemotherapy considered in appropriately selected patients (good performance status, resectable disease) to improve outcomes [@pubmed:33850907; @pubmed:36338689].

- For platinum-sensitive relapse after response to platinum-based chemotherapy, PARP inhibitor maintenance (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib) is recommended in patients in CR/PR/NED, with regimens chosen according to prior bevacizumab, BRCA/HRD status, and toxicity profile [@guideline:esgo_esmo_esp_consensus_ovariancancer_2024__v00000000|10; @guideline:esmo_cpg_epithelialovarian_2023__v00000000|10].

- Olaparib maintenance in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer significantly prolongs progression-free survival, particularly in BRCA-mutated or HRD tumors, and is now standard of care in this setting after response to platinum [@pubmed:31205507; @pubmed:38525421].

- HRD and BRCA status should be reassessed or confirmed at relapse if not previously characterized, as they critically inform the choice and expected benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance and other targeted strategies [@pubmed:38525421; @guideline:esmo_cpg_epithelialovarian_2023__v00000000|10].

- When considering PARPi vs bevacizumab at relapse, decision factors include histologic subtype, BRCA/HRD status, prior exposure to PARPi and/or bevacizumab, cumulative platinum exposure, expected toxicities, comorbidities, and patient preference [@guideline:esmo_cpg_epithelialovarian_2023__v00000000|10].

- For patients with platinum-resistant disease or those unsuitable for further platinum, non-platinum single-agent chemotherapy options include weekly paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, and gemcitabine; early integration of palliative care and prioritization for clinical trials is advised in fit patients [@guideline:esmo_cpg_epithelialovarian_2023__v00000000|10].

- Data on primary and maintenance therapy for less common histologies (e.g., low-grade or rare subtypes such as carcinosarcoma) are limited; management generally follows high-grade serous ovarian cancer paradigms, but participation in clinical trials or individualized off-label use (e.g., PARPi in selected cases) may be considered with multidisciplinary discussion [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14; @pubmed:34938651].</pre>
