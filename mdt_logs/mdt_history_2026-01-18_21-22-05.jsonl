metabolic characterization and full disease extent remain undefined.\n\nControversies:\n- Primary site and histologic subtype (ovarian vs other pelvic origin) not pathologically confirmed; current working label of epithelial ovarian cancer is unsupported by documented histology/IHC.\n- Line of therapy and prior systemic treatment history unclear, limiting safe regimen selection and trial eligibility assessment.\n- Clinical actionability of isolated germline ATM variant in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease remains uncertain for current systemic strategy.\n\nMissing Info:\n- Full pathology for primary and any recurrent/metastatic sites: histology, grade, FIGO stage, IHC profile, and complete reports/addenda.\n- Comprehensive oncologic treatment history: surgeries, chemo regimens, radiotherapy, maintenance (including PARP), timelines, responses.\n- Updated imaging since 2022‑12 (CT/MR/PET), including assessment of liver, bone, and possible splenic lesion; any signs of obstruction, nerve/spinal compromise, or fracture risk.\n- Detailed anemia workup and transfusion/bleeding history.\n- Current performance status, symptom burden (incl. pain, bowel/bladder function), comorbidities, medications (esp. anticoagulants), and patient goals/intent.\n\nWorking Plan:\n- Obtain and review full pathology (primary and metastatic, with IHC) and clarify the diagnostic basis for any presumed epithelial ovarian origin before defining systemic strategy.\n- Retrieve complete prior treatment record and establish the current line of therapy and treatment intent.\n- Urgently investigate and manage anemia and lymphopenia before considering myelosuppressive systemic therapy.\n- Arrange updated cross‑sectional imaging and consider PET/CT to refine staging and identify complications (obstruction, neurologic compromise, fracture risk).\n- Defer systemic regimen choice and trial consideration until pathology, staging, and prior treatment history are clarified; then align options with performance status and patient‑stated goals, including palliative‑focused care if appropriate.", "timestamp": "2026-01-18T21:20:22.021299"}]}, "trace_events": [{"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:06.838331", "event": "pipeline_start", "payload": {"visit_time": "2023-01-03 08:53:29.260000", "meta_info": "340123197709263626"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:06.838517", "event": "case_fingerprint", "payload": {"case_fingerprint": "bf21a9e8fbc5"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:07.113403", "event": "reports_loaded", "payload": {"lab_n": 92, "img_n": 10, "path_n": 0, "mut_n": 1, "cutoff_dt": "2023-01-04 08:53:29"}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:20.136440", "event": "reports_selected", "payload": {"lab": {"chair": ["20221229|8300002|2022-12-29", "20221229|9703212|2022-12-29", "20230103|5600862|2023-01-03"], "oncologist": ["20221229|8300002|2022-12-29", "20221229|9703212|2022-12-29", "20230103|5600862|2023-01-03"], "radiologist": [], "pathologist": [], "nuclear": []}, "imaging": {"chair": ["2022-10-24|MR|2022-10-24", "2022-12-29|MR|2022-12-29", "2022-12-29|CT|2022-12-29"], "oncologist": [], "radiologist": ["2022-10-24|MR|2022-10-24", "2022-12-29|MR|2022-12-29", "2022-12-29|CT|2022-12-29"], "pathologist": [], "nuclear": ["2022-10-24|CT|2022-10-24", "2022-12-29|MR|2022-12-29", "2022-12-29|CT|2022-12-29"]}, "pathology": {"chair": [], "oncologist": [], "radiologist": [], "pathologist": [], "nuclear": []}, "mutation": {"chair": ["OH2203828|2022-04-18"], "oncologist": ["OH2203828|2022-04-18"], "radiologist": [], "pathologist": ["OH2203828|2022-04-18"], "nuclear": []}}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:40.659899", "event": "rag_query", "payload": {"query": "Guidelines for management of platinum-unknown ovarian cancer with unspecified histology and metastatic extent, with no reported BRCA/HRD/MSI/PD-L1 status or major comorbid constraints, including recommendations for systemic therapy and follow‑up."}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:40.659927", "event": "rag_hits", "payload": {"source": "guideline", "topk": 5, "n": 5}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:40.659932", "event": "rag_hits", "payload": {"source": "pubmed", "topk": 5, "n": 5}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:40.659936", "event": "rag_hits_merged", "payload": {"n": 10}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:18:48.225667", "event": "mdt_discussion_start", "payload": {"num_rounds": 2, "num_turns": 2}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:21:59.127164", "event": "mdt_discussion_end", "payload": {"merged_chars": 2830}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:21:59.128095", "event": "final_output_start", "payload": {}}, {"ts": "2026-01-18T21:22:05.686145", "event": "final_output_end", "payload": {"final_output_chars": 1443}}], "trace_mermaid": "flowchart TD\n  A[Load Case + Fingerprint] --> B[Load Reports]\n  B --> C[Report Selection per Role]\n  C --> D[Guideline+PubMed RAG]\n  D --> E[Init Specialist Agents]\n  E --> F[MDT Discussion Engine]\n  F --> G[Trial Matching]\n  G --> H[Final Chair Output]\n  H --> I[Save Logs]\n"}
