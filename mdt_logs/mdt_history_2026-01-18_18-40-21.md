## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Widely metastatic presumed gynecologic malignancy with liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease and severe anemia; primary histology, prior treatments, and current stage/line remain uncertain, so only diagnostic and supportive steps are appropriate today [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @20230103|5600862].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently retrieve all prior surgical/biopsy pathology and reports to establish primary site, histologic subtype, grade, and stage; currently unknown.  
- If prior pathology unobtainable, plan image‑guided biopsy of an accessible metastatic lesion after restaging to secure diagnosis and IHC.  
- Arrange updated whole‑body staging (contrast CT/MR ± FDG PET/CT) to reassess liver, presacral, bone, peritoneal, and rectal involvement before therapy [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].  
- Optimize severe anemia with full work‑up and supportive treatment to ensure future systemic‑therapy fitness; repeat CBC and chemistries for baseline [@20230103|5600862].  

Change Triggers:
- If pathology confirms epithelial ovarian primary and imaging shows widespread metastatic disease, MDT to define systemic treatment intent and palliative focus [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- If restaging reveals complications (obstruction, impending fracture, spinal/pelvic instability), prioritize urgent surgical/radiation/palliative interventions before systemic therapy planning.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Advanced recurrent ovarian malignancy with progressive pelvic mass, pelvic bone lesion, and liver metastases on recent imaging [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  
- HRD-/BRCA‑wildtype; systemic therapy plan should not assume PARP benefit outside trial; consider standard chemotherapy-based approach [@OH2203828].  
- Profound anemia (HGB 74 g/L) likely requires optimization and transfusion planning before intensive systemic therapy [@20230103|2023-01-03].  
- Tumor markers very elevated (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3); can be used for response monitoring, not for standalone decisions [@20221229|9703212].  
- Missing: current histology/grade, prior surgery/chemo details, performance status, symptoms, patient goals—must be updated before definitive systemic/locoregional plan.
```


## oncologist

```
- Tumor type, stage, prior surgery/chemotherapy, and current disease status are unknown/needs update to define treatment line and intent.  

- Markedly elevated CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3 and ROMA suggest ovarian malignancy, but histology/pathology report is unknown/needs update [@20221229|9703212].  

- HRD negative and no BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants; this limits certain maintenance options after platinum response [@OH2203828|2022-04-18; @guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|18].  

- Significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) requires evaluation of cause and correction before or during systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  

- Renal and hepatic function appear adequate for most systemic options, but full current labs and trends are unknown/needs update [@20221229|8300002].
```


## radiologist

```
- Presacral pelvic mass enlarged to 53×44 mm with heterogeneous signal and involvement of adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, suspicious recurrence.[@2022-12-29|MR]

- New enhancing nodule in right ilium, concerning for osseous metastasis.[@2022-12-29|MR]

- Multiple enhancing mesenteric/pelvic nodules unchanged, compatible with peritoneal metastases.[@2022-12-29|MR]

- Focal rectal wall thickening with enhancement; needs correlation for invasion versus inflammatory change.[@2022-12-29|MR]

- Liver with multiple new/enlarging hypodense lesions, consistent with progressive hepatic metastases; additional stable hepatic cysts and possible splenic infarct.[@2022-12-29|CT]
```


## pathologist

```
- Only confirmed finding: germline ATM exon8 c.A947G:p.Y316C variant; clinical significance not specified in report [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- HRD reported negative; no pathogenic germline/somatic BRCA1/2, TP53, ARID1A, PTEN, PIK3CA, PALB2, RAD51D, BRIP1, BARD1 detected [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- Underlying tumor type, primary site, histologic subtype, grade, and stage are completely unknown/need update.  
- No tumor tissue NGS, MSI/MMR, TMB, or other somatic profiling data available/needs update for integrated pathology assessment.  
- Need full surgical pathology report(s) and any IHC panels to clarify diagnosis and guide biomarker interpretation.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT or other nuclear imaging available for this visit; metabolic status of pelvic, hepatic, bone lesions unknown/needs update.  

- Prior MR pelvis shows enlarging presacral mass with sacrum, peritoneum, right ilium involvement; recurrence/metastasis structurally suspected [@2022-12-29|MR].  

- Prior CT abdomen shows multiple enlarging hepatic lesions consistent with metastases; PET would better characterize whole-body disease burden [@2022-12-29|CT].  

- For current decision-making, a whole-body FDG PET/CT is needed to assess metabolic activity and refine staging/recurrence mapping.  

- Cannot yet determine if PET would upstage or downstage compared with prior MR/CT; requires new PET/CT acquisition and report.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Progressive advanced ovarian malignancy with enlarging presacral mass (sacrum/peritoneum), new right iliac bone lesion, peritoneal disease, and liver metastases on 12/2022 MR/CT.
- HRD negative, BRCA-wildtype; ATM variant of uncertain significance; no known actionable HRR mutation.
- Marked anemia (Hgb ~74 g/L) requiring optimization; renal/hepatic function likely adequate for chemotherapy.
- Tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3) markedly elevated and suitable for monitoring.
- Newer imaging than 12/29/2022 is referenced but not available; current decisions need truly up‑to‑date staging.

Controversies:
- Line of therapy and overall intent (palliative vs disease-controlling) cannot be safely defined without prior treatment history, performance status, and updated imaging.
- Histologic subtype/grade unknown, limiting precision of systemic strategy and trial eligibility.
- Clinical significance of rectal wall changes (true invasion vs inflammation; need for local palliation) remains uncertain.
- Extent to which PET/CT vs additional CT/MR should guide restaging and planning.

Missing Info:
- Original and any subsequent pathology: primary site confirmation, histologic subtype, grade, stage, IHC, full surgical/biopsy reports.
- Detailed oncologic history: surgeries, systemic regimens, responses, toxicities, timing/pattern of relapse.
- Current clinical status: ECOG, symptom burden (pain, bowel/bladder, bleeding), weight, comorbidities, patient goals.
- Updated labs: CBC trends, renal/hepatic function, coagulation, and anemia work-up/plan.
- All imaging after 12/29/2022, including any CT/MR and any PET/CT if already performed.
- Tumor somatic profiling (NGS, MSI/MMR, TMB, PD-L1), if ever done.

Working Plan:
- Prioritize retrieval and summary of original surgical/biopsy pathology (including subtype and grade).
- Confirm and collect all post‑12/2022 imaging; if not done, arrange comprehensive restaging with whole‑body FDG PET/CT and radiology review (including bone and rectal involvement).
- Clarify full oncologic history, current ECOG status, symptom burden, comorbidities, and patient preferences/goals.
- Evaluate and correct anemia; optimize medical status in parallel with staging.
- Obtain or repeat tumor tissue profiling (MSI/MMR, TMB ± extended NGS) if feasible.
- Defer systemic/locoregional treatment planning until updated imaging and pathology are available, then reconvene MDT to define intent, line of therapy, and any required local palliation.
[R2T1 DELTA] pathologist->chair(safety): Pathology remains completely unavailable; without confirmed primary site, histologic subtype, and grade, it is unsafe to finalize systemic strategy or trial eligibility discussions.
[R2T2 DELTA] chair->oncologist(safety): Do not commit to a specific systemic regimen or line-of-therapy labelling until original/surgical pathology is retrieved and reviewed. | chair->pathologist(missing): Please urgently trace outside surgical/biopsy blocks/reports or arrange a new biopsy if prior pathology truly cannot be obtained. | oncologist->chair(safety): Agree it is unsafe to finalize systemic options without pathology; treatment discussion with patient should be framed as provisional pending histologic confirmation.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before committing to a new regimen, we must clarify prior systemic lines, ECOG status, and urgent anemia optimization/plan; otherwise treatment intensity and intent are unsafe to define.
- **chair → nuclear:** Given new bone and progressive liver disease, please comment whether PET/CT would materially change management versus proceeding on current MR/CT.
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic regimen choice is impossible today without prior treatment history, performance status, and pathology details; these must be collected before committing to next-line therapy.
- **oncologist → nuclear:** Given new bone and progressive visceral disease, please advise whether PET/CT adds actionable value over recent MR/CT for systemic-planning and potential local palliation decisions.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** No imaging newer than 12/29/2022 is available; updated cross‑sectional imaging or PET/CT is needed before current treatment decisions.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** If clinically appropriate, a whole‑body FDG PET/CT would better define current disease extent, especially bone and rectal involvement.
- **pathologist → chair:** Pathology for this ovarian malignancy is entirely absent in the record; we need original surgical/biopsy reports and IHC to confirm primary, subtype, and grade.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** Given suspected pelvic, hepatic, peritoneal, and new bone involvement, a whole-body FDG PET/CT would refine staging and recurrence mapping before finalizing systemic or local palliation plans.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** Please consider PET/CT to clarify metabolic activity and true extent of presacral mass, right iliac lesion, liver metastases, and possible rectal involvement.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Management planning should wait for updated imaging and retrieval of original pathology; without these, defining intent and line of therapy is unsafe.
- **chair → radiologist:** Please confirm if any post-12/29/2022 imaging exists and whether additional CT/MR is still needed alongside planned PET/CT.
- **chair → pathologist:** Kindly prioritize obtaining and summarizing the original surgical/biopsy pathology with subtype and grade so systemic strategy is appropriately tailored.

### Round 2

#### Turn 1
- **pathologist → chair:** Pathology remains completely unavailable; without confirmed primary site, histologic subtype, and grade, it is unsafe to finalize systemic strategy or trial eligibility discussions.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Do not commit to a specific systemic regimen or line-of-therapy labelling until original/surgical pathology is retrieved and reviewed.
- **chair → pathologist:** Please urgently trace outside surgical/biopsy blocks/reports or arrange a new biopsy if prior pathology truly cannot be obtained.
- **oncologist → chair:** Agree it is unsafe to finalize systemic options without pathology; treatment discussion with patient should be framed as provisional pending histologic confirmation.

- Urgently obtain original surgical/biopsy pathology (reports and blocks) to confirm primary site, histologic subtype, grade, and stage; currently unknown.  
- If outside pathology truly unobtainable, arrange new image‑guided biopsy of accessible lesion for full histology and IHC; currently unknown.  
- With confirmed subtype, consider tumor profiling (MSI/MMR, TMB ± extended NGS) on available tissue for future options; currently unknown.  
- Correlate pathology with updated cross‑sectional imaging or PET/CT to clarify rectal involvement and dominant disease sites; post‑12/2022 imaging unknown.  
- Defer labeling line of therapy or specific systemic strategy until histology/subtype are established and MDT re‑reviews integrated findings.
```


## nuclear

```
- Arrange whole-body FDG PET/CT to update staging beyond 12/2022 CT/MR, including bone and rectal involvement assessment [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  
- Use PET/CT to confirm metabolic activity of presacral mass, sacral/iliac lesions, peritoneal nodules, and liver metastases [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  
- Correlate PET/CT with pelvic MR to better distinguish rectal invasion from inflammatory thickening before considering local interventions [@2022-12-29|MR].  
- Integrate PET findings with tumor marker trends and future imaging for monitoring disease burden and response; current post-12/2022 imaging unknown.  
- Re-discuss at MDT once PET/CT and pathology are available to align metabolic staging with final intent and palliation planning.

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Progressive advanced ovarian malignancy with enlarging presacral mass (sacrum/peritoneum), new right iliac bone lesion, peritoneal nodules, and progressive liver metastases (12/2022 MR/CT).
- HRD negative, BRCA-wildtype; ATM variant of uncertain significance; no known actionable HRR mutation.
- Marked anemia (Hgb ~74 g/L) needing optimization; renal/hepatic function likely adequate for chemotherapy.
- Tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3) very elevated; suitable for monitoring only.

Controversies:
- Line of therapy and intent (palliative vs disease-controlling) unclear without prior treatment history and PS.
- Histologic subtype/grade unknown, limiting targeted/trial options.
- Significance of rectal wall involvement (true invasion vs inflammation; need for local palliation) uncertain.
- Whether to proceed on current MR/CT vs obtain PET/CT for restaging first.

Missing Info:
- Full pathology: primary site confirmation, histology, grade, stage, IHC, prior surgical pathology.
- Detailed oncologic history: surgeries, systemic regimens, responses, toxicities, timing of relapse.
- Current clinical status: ECOG, symptom burden (pain, bowel/bladder, bleeding), weight, comorbidities, patient goals.
- Updated labs (CBC trends, renal/hepatic, coagulation) and anemia work-up/plan.
- Any prior somatic profiling (NGS, MSI/MMR, TMB, PD-L1) and imaging after 12/2022.

Working Plan:
- Obtain/clarify pathology, oncologic history, current performance status, and patient goals to define intent and line of therapy.
- Investigate and correct anemia; optimize overall medical status.
- Perform comprehensive restaging, ideally whole-body FDG PET/CT, to map full disease burden (including bone and rectal involvement).
- Arrange tumor tissue profiling (MSI/MMR, TMB ± extended NGS) if feasible for future options/trials.
- Reconvene MDT after data completion to define systemic strategy and any locoregional palliation needs (pelvic mass, bone, rectal involvement).

  **Assistant:** Final Assessment:
Widely metastatic presumed gynecologic malignancy with liver, presacral, bone, and peritoneal disease and severe anemia; primary histology, prior treatments, and current stage/line remain uncertain, so only diagnostic and supportive steps are appropriate today [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @20230103|5600862].

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently retrieve all prior surgical/biopsy pathology and reports to establish primary site, histologic subtype, grade, and stage; currently unknown.  
- If prior pathology unobtainable, plan image‑guided biopsy of an accessible metastatic lesion after restaging to secure diagnosis and IHC.  
- Arrange updated whole‑body staging (contrast CT/MR ± FDG PET/CT) to reassess liver, presacral, bone, peritoneal, and rectal involvement before therapy [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT; @guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11].  
- Optimize severe anemia with full work‑up and supportive treatment to ensure future systemic‑therapy fitness; repeat CBC and chemistries for baseline [@20230103|5600862].  

Change Triggers:
- If pathology confirms epithelial ovarian primary and imaging shows widespread metastatic disease, MDT to define systemic treatment intent and palliative focus [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14].  
- If restaging reveals complications (obstruction, impending fracture, spinal/pelvic instability), prioritize urgent surgical/radiation/palliative interventions before systemic therapy planning.

- HRD negative, BRCA-wildtype; ATM variant of uncertain significance; no known actionable HRR mutation.
- Marked anemia (Hgb ~74 g/L) requiring optimization; renal/hepatic function likely adequate for chemotherapy.
- Tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3) markedly elevated and suitable for monitoring.
- Newer imaging than 12/29/2022 is referenced but not available; current decisions need truly up‑to‑date staging.

Controversies:
- Line of therapy and overall intent (palliative vs disease-controlling) cannot be safely defined without prior treatment history, performance status, and updated imaging.
- Histologic subtype/grade unknown, limiting precision of systemic strategy and trial eligibility.
- Clinical significance of rectal wall changes (true invasion vs inflammation; need for local palliation) remains uncertain.
- Extent to which PET/CT vs additional CT/MR should guide restaging and planning.

Missing Info:
- Original and any subsequent pathology: primary site confirmation, histologic subtype, grade, stage, IHC, full surgical/biopsy reports.
- Detailed oncologic history: surgeries, systemic regimens, responses, toxicities, timing/pattern of relapse.
- Current clinical status: ECOG, symptom burden (pain, bowel/bladder, bleeding), weight, comorbidities, patient goals.
- Updated labs: CBC trends, renal/hepatic function, coagulation, and anemia work-up/plan.
- All imaging after 12/29/2022, including any CT/MR and any PET/CT if already performed.
- Tumor somatic profiling (NGS, MSI/MMR, TMB, PD-L1), if ever done.

Working Plan:
- Prioritize retrieval and summary of original surgical/biopsy pathology (including subtype and grade).
- Confirm and collect all post‑12/2022 imaging; if not done, arrange comprehensive restaging with whole‑body FDG PET/CT and radiology review (including bone and rectal involvement).
- Clarify full oncologic history, current ECOG status, symptom burden, comorbidities, and patient preferences/goals.
- Evaluate and correct anemia; optimize medical status in parallel with staging.
- Obtain or repeat tumor tissue profiling (MSI/MMR, TMB ± extended NGS) if feasible.
- Defer systemic/locoregional treatment planning until updated imaging and pathology are available, then reconvene MDT to define intent, line of therapy, and any required local palliation.
[R2T1 DELTA] pathologist->chair(safety): Pathology remains completely unavailable; without confirmed primary site, histologic subtype, and grade, it is unsafe to finalize systemic strategy or trial eligibility discussions.
[R2T2 DELTA] chair->oncologist(safety): Do not commit to a specific systemic regimen or line-of-therapy labelling until original/surgical pathology is retrieved and reviewed. | chair->pathologist(missing): Please urgently trace outside surgical/biopsy blocks/reports or arrange a new biopsy if prior pathology truly cannot be obtained. | oncologist->chair(safety): Agree it is unsafe to finalize systemic options without pathology; treatment discussion with patient should be framed as provisional pending histologic confirmation.

  **Assistant:** - Arrange whole-body FDG PET/CT to update staging beyond 12/2022 CT/MR, including bone and rectal involvement assessment [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  
- Use PET/CT to confirm metabolic activity of presacral mass, sacral/iliac lesions, peritoneal nodules, and liver metastases [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  
- Correlate PET/CT with pelvic MR to better distinguish rectal invasion from inflammatory thickening before considering local interventions [@2022-12-29|MR].  
- Integrate PET findings with tumor marker trends and future imaging for monitoring disease burden and response; current post-12/2022 imaging unknown.  
- Re-discuss at MDT once PET/CT and pathology are available to align metabolic staging with final intent and palliation planning.
