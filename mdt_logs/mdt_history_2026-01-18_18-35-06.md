## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Disseminated metastatic pelvic malignancy with liver, presacral/sacral, mesenteric, rectal, and right iliac bone involvement [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR], severe anemia [@20230103|5600862], but histologic type, primary site, prior treatments, and performance status remain unknown and prevent evidence-based systemic regimen selection.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently obtain and review all surgical/biopsy pathology with IHC; pathologist to issue integrated working diagnosis and origin (currently unknown).  
- Collect complete treatment history, ECOG, symptom burden, and anemia/bleeding workup; arrange transfusion/supportive care to correct Hgb before therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Request somatic tumor NGS including MSI/TMB and formal clarification of ATM p.Y316C classification with genetics lab [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine bone/peritoneal mapping and biopsy targeting, without delaying palliative systemic planning justified by CT/MR [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].  

Change Triggers:
- If pathology and history define primary site and prior lines, then finalize palliative systemic regimen and any symptom-directed local therapies.  
- If ECOG poor, uncontrolled anemia/bleeding, or patient prefers comfort-focused care, then prioritize best supportive care over aggressive systemic treatment.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive presacral mass, pelvic peritoneal disease and new multiple liver metastases by Dec 2022 [@2022-12-29|MR; @2022-12-29|CT].  
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) and lymphopenia; performance status, symptoms, and bleeding source must be clarified before systemic therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Tumor markers (very high CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3) support active disease; histologic subtype and prior treatments are unknown [@20221229|9703212].  
- HRD-negative, BRCA-wild type; only germline ATM variant known, limiting standard maintenance options [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- Must obtain: pathology report (histology, stage), prior systemic/surgical treatments, ECOG status, current symptoms, renal function trend, and patient goals.
```


## oncologist

```
- Diagnosis, disease stage, prior systemic therapy line, and treatment intent are all unknown/needs update before regimen decision.  

- Current labs show significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with otherwise adequate neutrophils and platelets for most systemic therapies [@20230103|5600862].  

- Renal and hepatic function appear adequate for standard dosing; mild AST/ALT elevation and normal bilirubin, creatinine, albumin acceptable [@20221229|8300002].  

- Tumor markers (CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, HE4, ROMA) markedly elevated, but primary tumor type and radiologic disease status unknown/needs update [@20221229|9703212].  

- Germline ATM variant with HRD negative and BRCA1/2 wild-type may limit some targeted options; broader somatic profiling and MSI/TMB unknown/needs update [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].
```


## radiologist

```
- Liver: multiple low-density metastases, increased number and size vs 2022-10-21; largest ~17×14 mm. [@2022-12-29|CT]  

- Liver: multiple non-enhancing cystic lesions, stable, consistent with hepatic cysts. [@2022-12-29|CT]  

- Pelvis: presacral mass 53×44 mm, enlarged, invading adjacent peritoneum and sacrum, post-surgical recurrence pattern. [@2022-12-29|MR]  

- Pelvis: multiple enhancing mesenteric nodules and new right iliac bone lesion, consistent with metastatic spread. [@2022-12-29|MR]  

- Rectum: focal wall thickening with enhancement; needs clinical correlation for obstruction symptoms and endoscopic evaluation. [@2022-12-29|MR]
```


## pathologist

```
- No histology, grade, or IHC available; primary diagnosis and tumor type cannot be confirmed. Update surgical pathology reports.  

- Germline ATM p.Y316C variant reported; clinical significance (pathogenic vs VUS) not specified. Clarify classification and lab interpretation [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  

- HRD reported negative; BRCA1/2 and other listed genes show no pathogenic germline variants [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  

- Somatic/tumor sequencing, MSI/TMB status, and actionable fusions or amplifications are unknown. Obtain comprehensive tumor molecular report if done.  

- Current pathology staging, margins, and involved sites (ovary vs other origin) are undocumented. Upload all prior and latest pathology reports.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT is available; whole-body FDG PET/CT is needed to assess metabolic activity of hepatic, pelvic, and bone lesions.  

- Prior CT/MR show multifocal liver lesions and pelvic mass with sacral and iliac bone involvement, highly suspicious for metastases/recurrence [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR; @2022-10-24|CT].  

- PET/CT could upstage disease by confirming extra-pelvic metastases (liver, bone, peritoneal nodules) and defining systemic versus localized recurrence.  

- PET/CT may better delineate sacral, right iliac bone, and rectal involvement for radiotherapy or surgical planning.  

- Need updated PET/CT, current clinical staging, and original pathology/histology report to refine recurrence pattern and staging assessment.
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum, mesenteric nodules, rectal involvement, right iliac bone lesion, and multiple progressive liver metastases (disseminated, not oligometastatic).
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with preserved neutrophils/platelets; renal/hepatic function acceptable for systemic therapy.
- Very high CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, HE4 indicating active disease; primary site and histology (gynecologic vs colorectal vs other pelvic) remain unconfirmed.
- Germline BRCA1/2 negative, HRD negative; ATM p.Y316C variant present but currently without clear actionable implication.
- No FDG PET/CT performed or scheduled; CT/MR already demonstrate widespread metastatic disease.

Controversies:
- Unclear primary site and histologic subtype, so systemic regimen choice is not evidence-based yet.
- Uncertain pathogenicity and therapeutic relevance of the germline ATM variant.
- Added value of PET/CT: it would refine extent and bone/peritoneal characterization but is unlikely to change overall metastatic staging or shift from systemic/palliative intent.
- Timing and intent of systemic treatment (palliative) cannot be finalized without pathology, prior treatment history, ECOG, and patient goals.

Missing Info:
- All pathology/IHC reports: primary diagnosis, histology/grade, stage, margins, and site of origin.
- Detailed prior treatment history: surgeries, systemic therapy lines (agents, responses, toxicities), radiotherapy.
- Current ECOG, symptom burden (pain, bleeding, obstruction), anemia/bleeding source; lab trends and transfusion history.
- Tumor molecular profiling: somatic NGS, MSI, TMB, and any actionable alterations/fusions.
- Any planned imaging updates; PET/CT not yet arranged.
- Patient preferences and goals of care.

Working Plan:
- Chair to obtain and upload full surgical/biopsy pathology (including IHC) and complete treatment history; pathologist to review and report working diagnosis and origin.
- Clarify ECOG, clinical symptoms, and evaluate anemia/bleeding (including GI/rectal workup as indicated); stabilize anemia.
- Request comprehensive somatic NGS with MSI/TMB; genetics lab to clarify ATM variant classification.
- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine mapping of bone/peritoneal disease, but do not allow PET/CT to delay necessary systemic palliation once diagnosis and goals are defined.
- Reconvene MDT after data collection to define intent (palliative), and plan systemic therapy and any symptom-directed local measures in line with patient goals.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before choosing any regimen, we must clarify primary site/histology and full prior treatment, and correct Hgb 74 g/L with source evaluation; current data are insufficient for intent or regimen selection.
- **chair → nuclear:** Please advise whether FDG PET/CT will materially change management given already multifocal liver, pelvic, and bone disease on CT/MR.
- **oncologist → pathologist:** We still lack a definitive primary site and histology; please prioritize integrated pathology/IHC review and report a working diagnosis.
- **oncologist → nuclear:** Given multifocal metastases and unclear primary, please comment whether PET/CT would materially change staging/management beyond current CT/MR.
- **radiologist → oncologist:** Current CT/MR already document widespread progressive liver, presacral, mesenteric, rectal, and right iliac bone involvement; additional PET/CT will refine but not likely convert this to oligometastatic disease.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** Please confirm if any FDG PET/CT is already done or scheduled; if not, whole-body PET/CT would refine metastatic extent and bone involvement beyond current CT/MR.
- **pathologist → chair:** Primary site and histology remain undefined; no pathology/IHC reports are in the record. Please obtain and upload all surgical/biopsy pathology for review, as current systemic decisions lack diagnostic confirmation.

#### Turn 2
- **chair → oncologist:** Given clearly multifocal progressive disease, focus first on clarifying primary/histology and stabilizing anemia; PET/CT should not delay necessary systemic palliation once diagnosis and goals are defined.
- **oncologist → chair:** Systemic regimen choice is impossible today without pathology, prior treatment history, ECOG, and goals of care; please prioritize collecting these before further MDT decisions.
- **nuclear → oncologist:** No PET/CT is in the record. Given clear multifocal liver, pelvic, and bone metastases on CT/MR, PET/CT would refine extent but is unlikely to change overall metastatic staging or convert management from systemic/palliative to oligometastatic intent.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** No prior or scheduled PET/CT is documented. I agree that whole-body FDG PET/CT would better characterize bone and peritoneal disease, but current CT/MR already establish disseminated metastases.

- Proceed with comprehensive somatic profiling including MSI/TMB and actionable alterations to broaden later-line options (unknown).  

- Order whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine distribution (especially bone/peritoneum), but do not delay palliation once diagnosis/goals set (unknown).  

- After data completion, reconvene MDT to set palliative intent and choose systemic vs local measures compatible with anemia and organ function [@20230103|5600862; @20221229|8300002].
```


## radiologist

```
- Current CT/MR already document disseminated metastatic disease in liver, pelvis, mesentery, rectum, and right iliac bone. [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR]  

- Obtain and upload all pathology/IHC and prior operative/biopsy reports to define primary site and histology; currently unknown.  

- Do not delay necessary palliative systemic management for PET/CT once pathology, performance status, and goals of care are clarified.  

- Consider FDG PET/CT to better map bone and peritoneal involvement, recognizing it will not change overall metastatic stage. [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR]  

- Correlate rectal wall thickening with GI evaluation to assess for primary colorectal origin and bleeding source. [@2022-12-29|MR]
```


## pathologist

```
- Obtain and review all surgical/biopsy pathology with IHC to define primary site, histologic subtype, and grade (currently unknown).  

- Request comprehensive somatic tumor profiling (NGS with MSI/TMB) to identify actionable alterations; only germline ATM variant known [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].

- After pathology and molecular clarification, reconvene MDT to agree on a working diagnosis and staging for this recurrent pelvic malignancy.  

- Address severe anemia with clinical workup for bleeding source and lab trends; current etiology and transfusion history are unknown.
```


## nuclear

```
- No PET/CT is available; whole-body FDG PET/CT may refine hepatic, presacral, peritoneal, and osseous disease assessment [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].  

- Current CT/MR already demonstrate disseminated metastatic disease (liver, presacral/sacral, mesenteric, right iliac bone, possible rectal) [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].  

- PET/CT is unlikely to change overall metastatic staging, but could better delineate bone/peritoneal involvement for local palliation planning [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].  

- PET/CT might help clarify dominant disease compartments and guide biopsy targeting if pathology/primary site remain uncertain (pathology currently unknown).  

- PET/CT should be adjunctive; systemic palliative intent would still be expected given multifocal progressive liver and pelvic metastases [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].
```

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum, mesenteric nodules, right iliac bone lesion, and multiple progressive liver metastases (Dec 2022).
- Significant anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) but adequate neutrophils/platelets; renal and hepatic function acceptable for systemic therapy.
- Very high CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, HE4 indicating active disease; primary (gynecologic vs colorectal vs other pelvic) unconfirmed.
- Germline BRCA1/2 negative, HRD negative; ATM p.Y316C variant reported, no clearly actionable germline target.
- No PET/CT; CT/MR already show multifocal metastatic involvement.

Controversies:
- Uncertain primary site and histologic subtype, limiting evidence-based systemic therapy choice.
- Unclear pathogenicity and therapeutic relevance of germline ATM variant.
- True extent of metastatic burden (systemic vs any potentially limited sites) unclear without PET/CT.
- Treatment intent (palliative vs any local control) undetermined pending staging, performance status, and patient goals.

- Tumor molecular profiling (somatic NGS, MSI, TMB, actionable alterations).
- Updated staging imaging including FDG PET/CT.
- Patient preferences and goals of care.

Working Plan:
- Obtain and review all pathology and detailed treatment history.
- Assess ECOG, symptoms, and investigate anemia/bleeding (including GI/rectal evaluation as indicated).
- Request comprehensive somatic NGS with MSI/TMB; clarify ATM variant classification with genetics lab.
- Arrange whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine staging and delineate pelvic, hepatic, bone, and rectal disease.

  **Assistant:** Final Assessment:
Disseminated metastatic pelvic malignancy with liver, presacral/sacral, mesenteric, rectal, and right iliac bone involvement [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR], severe anemia [@20230103|5600862], but histologic type, primary site, prior treatments, and performance status remain unknown and prevent evidence-based systemic regimen selection.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently obtain and review all surgical/biopsy pathology with IHC; pathologist to issue integrated working diagnosis and origin (currently unknown).  
- Collect complete treatment history, ECOG, symptom burden, and anemia/bleeding workup; arrange transfusion/supportive care to correct Hgb before therapy [@20230103|5600862].  
- Request somatic tumor NGS including MSI/TMB and formal clarification of ATM p.Y316C classification with genetics lab [@OH2203828|2022-04-18].  
- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine bone/peritoneal mapping and biopsy targeting, without delaying palliative systemic planning justified by CT/MR [@2022-12-29|CT; @2022-12-29|MR].  

Change Triggers:
- If pathology and history define primary site and prior lines, then finalize palliative systemic regimen and any symptom-directed local therapies.  
- If ECOG poor, uncontrolled anemia/bleeding, or patient prefers comfort-focused care, then prioritize best supportive care over aggressive systemic treatment.

- **User:** Given MDT context:
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum, mesenteric nodules, rectal involvement, right iliac bone lesion, and multiple progressive liver metastases (disseminated, not oligometastatic).
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with preserved neutrophils/platelets; renal/hepatic function acceptable for systemic therapy.
- Very high CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, HE4 indicating active disease; primary site and histology (gynecologic vs colorectal vs other pelvic) remain unconfirmed.
- Germline BRCA1/2 negative, HRD negative; ATM p.Y316C variant present but currently without clear actionable implication.
- No FDG PET/CT performed or scheduled; CT/MR already demonstrate widespread metastatic disease.

Controversies:
- Unclear primary site and histologic subtype, so systemic regimen choice is not evidence-based yet.
- Uncertain pathogenicity and therapeutic relevance of the germline ATM variant.
- Added value of PET/CT: it would refine extent and bone/peritoneal characterization but is unlikely to change overall metastatic staging or shift from systemic/palliative intent.
- Timing and intent of systemic treatment (palliative) cannot be finalized without pathology, prior treatment history, ECOG, and patient goals.

Missing Info:
- All pathology/IHC reports: primary diagnosis, histology/grade, stage, margins, and site of origin.
- Detailed prior treatment history: surgeries, systemic therapy lines (agents, responses, toxicities), radiotherapy.
- Current ECOG, symptom burden (pain, bleeding, obstruction), anemia/bleeding source; lab trends and transfusion history.
- Tumor molecular profiling: somatic NGS, MSI, TMB, and any actionable alterations/fusions.
- Any planned imaging updates; PET/CT not yet arranged.
- Patient preferences and goals of care.

Working Plan:
- Chair to obtain and upload full surgical/biopsy pathology (including IHC) and complete treatment history; pathologist to review and report working diagnosis and origin.
- Clarify ECOG, clinical symptoms, and evaluate anemia/bleeding (including GI/rectal workup as indicated); stabilize anemia.
- Request comprehensive somatic NGS with MSI/TMB; genetics lab to clarify ATM variant classification.
- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine mapping of bone/peritoneal disease, but do not allow PET/CT to delay necessary systemic palliation once diagnosis and goals are defined.
- Reconvene MDT after data collection to define intent (palliative), and plan systemic therapy and any symptom-directed local measures in line with patient goals.

CONTEXT (latest):
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with presacral mass invading sacrum/peritoneum, mesenteric nodules, rectal involvement, right iliac bone lesion, and multiple progressive liver metastases (disseminated, not oligometastatic).
- Marked anemia (Hgb 74 g/L) with preserved neutrophils/platelets; renal/hepatic function acceptable for systemic therapy.
- Very high CA125, CA19-9, CA15-3, HE4 indicating active disease; primary site and histology (gynecologic vs colorectal vs other pelvic) remain unconfirmed.
- Germline BRCA1/2 negative, HRD negative; ATM p.Y316C variant present but currently without clear actionable implication.
- No FDG PET/CT performed or scheduled; CT/MR already demonstrate widespread metastatic disease.

Controversies:
- Unclear primary site and histologic subtype, so systemic regimen choice is not evidence-based yet.
- Uncertain pathogenicity and therapeutic relevance of the germline ATM variant.
- Added value of PET/CT: it would refine extent and bone/peritoneal characterization but is unlikely to change overall metastatic staging or shift from systemic/palliative intent.
- Timing and intent of systemic treatment (palliative) cannot be finalized without pathology, prior treatment history, ECOG, and patient goals.

Missing Info:
- All pathology/IHC reports: primary diagnosis, histology/grade, stage, margins, and site of origin.
- Detailed prior treatment history: surgeries, systemic therapy lines (agents, responses, toxicities), radiotherapy.
- Current ECOG, symptom burden (pain, bleeding, obstruction), anemia/bleeding source; lab trends and transfusion history.
- Tumor molecular profiling: somatic NGS, MSI, TMB, and any actionable alterations/fusions.
- Any planned imaging updates; PET/CT not yet arranged.
- Patient preferences and goals of care.

Working Plan:
- Chair to obtain and upload full surgical/biopsy pathology (including IHC) and complete treatment history; pathologist to review and report working diagnosis and origin.
- Clarify ECOG, clinical symptoms, and evaluate anemia/bleeding (including GI/rectal workup as indicated); stabilize anemia.
- Request comprehensive somatic NGS with MSI/TMB; genetics lab to clarify ATM variant classification.
- Consider whole-body FDG PET/CT to refine mapping of bone/peritoneal disease, but do not allow PET/CT to delay necessary systemic palliation once diagnosis and goals are defined.
- Reconvene MDT after data collection to define intent (palliative), and plan systemic therapy and any symptom-directed local measures in line with patient goals.
