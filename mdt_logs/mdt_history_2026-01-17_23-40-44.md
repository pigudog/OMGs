## FINAL MDT OUTPUT

```
Final Assessment:
Advanced epithelial adnexal malignancy with peritoneal and nodal disease on neoadjuvant platinum–taxane, but histologic subtype, response, and operability remain insufficiently characterized for definitive surgical versus systemic sequencing decisions.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Do not commit today to interval debulking; await structured radiology response and resectability assessment integrating CT and PET findings (requested, pending).  
- Obtain urgent comprehensive preoperative assessment (ECOG, comorbidities, nutrition, anesthetic risk, chemo tolerance) to determine surgical fitness and perioperative risk.  
- Complete IHC and finalize histology (subtype, grade, primary site), then proceed with germline and somatic profiling to plan maintenance.  
- Maintain platinum-taxane–based systemic strategy in principle, but adjust intensity and timing only after imaging, pathology, molecular, and fitness data are integrated.  

Change Triggers:
- If imaging shows substantial response and disease judged resectable with acceptable risk, shift toward interval debulking followed by systemic/maintenance therapy.  
- If imaging or fitness assessment indicates unresectable disease or prohibitive surgical risk, prioritize continued systemic therapy and defer debulking, reassessing periodically.

## INITIAL EXPERT OPINIONS


## chair

```
- Advanced ovarian malignancy with peritoneal and nodal spread; partial biochemical response to two neoadjuvant platinum–taxane cycles.  
- Before surgery decision, urgently need updated performance status, comorbidities, nutritional status, and anesthetic risk assessment.  
- Require standardized radiology comparison (baseline vs 2025-07-01 CT and prior PET/CT) to quantify response and resectability.  
- Pathology incomplete: need IHC, definitive histologic subtype, grade, and tumor origin confirmation; then order germline and somatic profiling (BRCA/HRD).  
- MDT to decide: interval debulking feasibility vs further neoadjuvant therapy once operability, pathology, and genetics are clarified.
```


## oncologist

```
- Advanced bilateral ovarian carcinoma with peritoneal, nodal, ascitic disease; currently post‑2 cycles neoadjuvant platinum‑taxane, evaluated for interval debulking.  

- Tumor markers (CA125, HE4, ROMA) substantially decreased but still elevated, suggesting partial response; detailed radiologic response assessment missing, needs updated CT/MRI.  

- Organ function, performance status, neuropathy, marrow and renal reserves are unknown/needs update to judge feasibility of continued platinum‑taxane and perioperative risk.  

- Germline and somatic mutation status (BRCA, HRR genes, MSI, others) unknown/needs update to plan postoperative maintenance and future systemic options.  

- Surgical team’s assessment of resectability and planned timing/extent of cytoreduction is unknown/needs update to coordinate systemic therapy sequencing.
```


## radiologist

```
- CT shows multiple small enhancing peritoneal and mesenteric nodules, consistent with disseminated peritoneal disease.[@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-07-01]

- Scattered small retroperitoneal lymph nodes; size and progression versus prior unclear, recommend comparison with earlier imaging.[@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-07-01]

- Prior CT demonstrated large bilateral adnexal masses with extensive peritoneal implants, ascites, and nodal disease, suggesting advanced pelvic malignancy.[@IMAGING_STUDIES|2025-04-26]

- PET/CT previously showed widespread FDG-avid pelvic, peritoneal, and nodal disease including supradiaphragmatic nodes, confirming systemic metastatic involvement.[@PET_IF_AVAILABLE|2025-04-29]

- Trend of adnexal masses, ascites volume, and nodal size between April and July CTs is unknown; need formal side-by-side comparison.
```


## pathologist

```
- Current material supports malignant epithelial tumor, favor adenocarcinoma, from pelvic/adnexal mass with malignant ascites cytology [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2025-04-28;2025-05-07;2025-05-08].  
- Tumor grade, exact subtype (e.g., high‑grade serous vs others), and primary site remain undetermined/uncertain [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2025-04-28].  
- No immunohistochemistry yet on core biopsy or ascites cell block; IHC panel urgently needed for definitive classification [@HISTOLOGY_AND_IHC|2025-05-08].  
- No molecular testing (HRD/BRCA, MSI, TMB, HER2, PD‑L1) reported; comprehensive predictive panel status unknown/needs update.  
- Staging information (imaging, surgical findings, peritoneal/organ involvement extent) missing; pathologic stage cannot be assigned, needs radiology/surgical reports.
```


## nuclear

```
- FDG-avid bilateral adnexal lesions with extensive peritoneal and pelvic implants indicate metabolically active adnexal primary with peritoneal carcinomatosis [@PET_CT|2025-04-29].  
- FDG-avid retroperitoneal, left iliac, costophrenic, internal mammary, and left supraclavicular nodes suggest disseminated nodal metastases, upstaging beyond locoregional disease [@PET_CT|2025-04-29].  
- PET/CT extends CT findings by confirming metabolic activity of peritoneal and nodal disease, strengthening suspicion for advanced-stage ovarian malignancy [@PET_CT|2025-04-29; @IMAGING_CONTEXT|2025-04-26].  
- PET meaningfully changes staging by demonstrating extra-abdominal nodal involvement (internal mammary, supraclavicular), implying at least distant metastatic spread [@PET_CT|2025-04-29].  
- For current visit, need histology, CA-125, prior treatments, and interval imaging to assess for recurrence vs. untreated advanced presentation (unknown/needs update).
```


## MERGED SUMMARY (Assistant)

```
Key Knowledge:
- Advanced epithelial ovarian malignancy with bilateral adnexal masses, peritoneal carcinomatosis, ascites, and widespread nodal metastases including supraclavicular nodes.
- Partial biochemical response after 2 cycles of neoadjuvant platinum–taxane (markers down but still elevated).
- PET/CT confirms metabolically active peritoneal and nodal disease intra‑ and extra‑abdominally.
- Pathology confirms malignant epithelial (likely adnexal adenocarcinoma), but subtype, grade, and primary site remain undefined.

Controversies:
- Interval debulking now versus further/modified neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
- Extent/goal of cytoreductive surgery in the context of extra‑abdominal nodal disease.
- Future systemic and maintenance approach pending BRCA/HRD and broader molecular profile.

Missing Info:
- Updated performance status, comorbidities, nutritional state, and anesthetic risk.
- Formal, structured side‑by‑side comparison of baseline vs 01‑07‑2025 CT with PET correlation, including quantified response and detailed assessment of peritoneal and nodal resectability.
- Final histology with IHC (subtype, grade, primary site).
- Germline and somatic profiling (BRCA/HRR, HRD, MSI, TMB, HER2, PD‑L1, etc.).
- Current organ function, neuropathy, and overall chemotherapy tolerance.

Working Plan:
- Perform urgent comprehensive preoperative and anesthetic assessment.
- Request a standardized CT/PET response and resectability report (baseline vs 01‑07‑2025), focusing on peritoneal and nodal operability.
- Complete IHC and finalize histologic classification, then proceed with germline and somatic genomic profiling.
- Reconvene MDT once operability, pathology, and molecular data are available to decide timing of interval debulking versus further neoadjuvant therapy and to define postoperative/maintenance systemic strategy.
```


## INTERACTION LOG (Round × Turn)

### Round 1

#### Turn 1
- **chair → oncologist:** Before deciding on interval debulking after only two neoadjuvant cycles, we need documented ECOG, comorbidities, organ function, and chemo tolerance, plus a clear statement of surgical fitness from anesthesia.
- **chair → radiologist:** Please provide a formal side‑by‑side response assessment comparing baseline CT/PET with 2025‑07‑01 CT, explicitly commenting on peritoneal disease burden, nodal status (including supraclavicular), and likelihood of achieving no gross residual disease.
- **chair → pathologist:** We urgently need IHC and a finalized report specifying histologic subtype, grade, and likely primary site from existing biopsy/ascites material to guide systemic and maintenance planning.
- **chair → nuclear:** If available, please comment on whether prior PET/CT suggests any sites that would predict unresectable residual disease despite aggressive cytoreduction, to inform timing and extent of surgery.
- **oncologist → radiologist:** Please provide a formal comparative report of baseline vs latest CT/PET, explicitly grading response and commenting on likelihood of complete/optimal cytoreduction, including extra-abdominal nodes.
- **oncologist → pathologist:** We need finalized histologic subtype, grade, and confirmed primary site with IHC as soon as possible to guide systemic and maintenance planning.
- **radiologist → chair:** A dedicated side‑by‑side review of baseline vs 2025-07-01 CT (and prior PET/CT) to quantify response and resectability is still pending and is critical before any surgical decision.
- **pathologist → oncologist:** Histology still lacks IHC, grade, and defined primary site; urgent immunophenotyping of core and cell‑block material is critical before final staging/strategy decisions.
- **pathologist → radiologist:** Please provide a structured baseline-versus-latest CT/PET comparison focused on peritoneal versus nodal disease resectability to align with pending definitive pathology.
- **nuclear → radiologist:** We lack a structured side‑by‑side comparison of baseline versus 01‑07‑2025 imaging, including PET correlation, specifically addressing operability/resectability of peritoneal and nodal disease; could you provide a standardized response and resectability report?

#### Turn 2
- **radiologist → chair:** From imaging alone, we still have no formal baseline-versus-2025-07-01 response/resectability report integrating CT and PET; this remains critical before interval debulking decisions.
- **radiologist → nuclear:** Agree a standardized side‑by‑side CT/PET response and resectability assessment is missing; once requested, I can structure it around peritoneal and nodal operability.

- Obtain full preoperative evaluation (performance, comorbidities, nutrition, organ function, neuropathy, anesthetic risk); surgery contingent on acceptable overall risk.  
- Prioritize pathology work‑up: IHC, grade, and primary site assignment on core and cell‑block material; escalate if delayed.  
- Initiate comprehensive germline and somatic profiling (BRCA/HRR, HRD, MSI, TMB, PD‑L1, HER2, others) once histologic subtype finalized.  
- Reconvene MDT promptly with imaging, pathology, and risk data to choose between interval debulking versus additional/modified neoadjuvant and outline postoperative/maintenance strategy.

Advanced epithelial adnexal malignancy with peritoneal and nodal disease on neoadjuvant platinum–taxane, but histologic subtype, response, and operability remain insufficiently characterized for definitive surgical versus systemic sequencing decisions.

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Do not commit today to interval debulking; await structured radiology response and resectability assessment integrating CT and PET findings (requested, pending).  
- Obtain urgent comprehensive preoperative assessment (ECOG, comorbidities, nutrition, anesthetic risk, chemo tolerance) to determine surgical fitness and perioperative risk.  
- Complete IHC and finalize histology (subtype, grade, primary site), then proceed with germline and somatic profiling to plan maintenance.  
- Maintain platinum-taxane–based systemic strategy in principle, but adjust intensity and timing only after imaging, pathology, molecular, and fitness data are integrated.  

Change Triggers:
- If imaging shows substantial response and disease judged resectable with acceptable risk, shift toward interval debulking followed by systemic/maintenance therapy.  
- If imaging or fitness assessment indicates unresectable disease or prohibitive surgical risk, prioritize continued systemic therapy and defer debulking, reassessing periodically.

[R1T1 DELTA] (missing): A dedicated side‑by‑side review of baseline vs 2025-07-01 CT (and prior PET/CT) to quantify response and resectability is still pending and is critical before any surgical decision. | pathologist->oncologist(missing): Histology still lacks IHC, grade, and defined primary site; urgent immunophenotyping of core and cell‑block material is critical before final staging/strategy decisions. | pathologist->radiologist(missing): Please provide a structured baseline-versus-latest CT/PET comparison focused on peritoneal versus nodal disease resectability to align with pending definitive pathology. | nuclear->radiologist(missing): We lack a structured side‑by‑side comparison of baseline versus 01‑07‑2025 imaging, including PET correlation, specifically addressing operability/resectability of peritoneal and nodal disease; could you provide a standardized response and resectability report?
[R1T2 DELTA] radiologist->chair(unspecified): From imaging alone, we still have no formal baseline-versus-2025-07-01 response/resectability report integrating CT and PET; this remains critical before interval debulking decisions. | radiologist->nuclear(unspecified): Agree a standardized side‑by‑side CT/PET response and resectability assessment is missing; once requested, I can structure it around peritoneal and nodal operability.
