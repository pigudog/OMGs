QUESTION:

RESPONSE:
Final Assessment:
Advanced recurrent pelvic malignancy with progressive pelvic, hepatic, and iliac bone disease and significant cytopenias; primary histology, prior treatments, and goals of care remain undefined, so only diagnostic and supportive steps are appropriate today. [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Urgently retrieve all pathology, operative notes, and full oncology records to define diagnosis, prior lines, and treatment intent (unknown/needs update).  
- Arrange focused workup and management of anemia/lymphopenia, including transfusion needs, before any cytotoxic or intensive therapy. [@20230103|5600862]  
- Document detailed performance status and symptom burden to guide feasibility of systemic, radiotherapy, or best-supportive-care–dominant strategies. (unknown/needs update)  
- Consider updated cross-sectional imaging and PET/FDG only if, after diagnosis/intent clarification, results would change systemic vs palliative/RT planning. [@2022-12-29|MR][@2022-12-29|CT][@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|14]

Change Triggers:
- If pathology and prior treatment history confirm a specific gynecologic primary and line of therapy, reconvene MDT to select systemic/RT approach.  
- If performance status or cytopenias prove poor or non-correctable, shift emphasis toward symptom-directed palliative care over disease-directed intensification.
