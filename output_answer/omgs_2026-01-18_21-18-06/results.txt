RESPONSE:
Final Assessment:
Systemic recurrent pelvic malignancy with hepatic and osseous metastases and severe anemia, but tumor origin, prior therapy, and current extent remain insufficiently defined for safe systemic treatment decisions. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT] [@20230103|5600862]

Core Treatment Strategy:
- Defer new systemic regimen and trial enrollment until full pathology, prior oncologic treatments, and performance status are clarified. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11]  
- Obtain and review complete pathology (primary and any metastases, including IHC, grade, stage) to define tumor origin and subtype. unknown/needs update  
- Arrange updated CT/MR and consider PET/CT to restage, assess obstruction/neurologic risk, and confirm current metastatic burden. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT] [@pubmed:35296733]  
- Urgently evaluate and manage anemia/lymphopenia (workup, transfusion as indicated) before any myelosuppressive therapy. [@20230103|5600862]

Change Triggers:
- If pathology confirms epithelial ovarian origin, align with epithelial ovarian systemic pathways, considering limited PARP role in HRD-/BRCA‑wt disease. [@guideline:nccn_ovariancancer_v3_2025__v00000000|11] [@OH2203828|2022-04-18]  
- If updated imaging or symptoms reveal obstruction, neurologic compromise, or fracture risk, prioritize urgent local/palliative interventions before systemic therapy. [@2022-12-29|MR] [@2022-12-29|CT]
