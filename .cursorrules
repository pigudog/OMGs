# OMGs Project Rules

When working on this project, read skills/omgs/SKILL.md first to understand:
- Three-layer architecture (host/ servers/ core/)
- Expert roles and permission matrix
- MDT discussion flow and evidence tag system

For extension tasks, refer to:
- Adding roles: skills/omgs/references/extension-guide.md
- Pipeline ops: skills/omgs/references/pipeline-ops.md
- Architecture details: skills/omgs/references/architecture.md
- Expert roles: skills/omgs/references/expert-roles.md

Key conventions:
- All expert responses must use evidence tags: [@guideline:doc_id|page], [@pubmed:PMID], [@trial:id], [@report_id|date]
- Do not modify core architecture without explicit request
- Configuration changes go in config/paths.json or config/mdt_prompts.json
