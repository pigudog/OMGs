The most commonly used radio­\ntracer, at present, is the 18F-labelled glucose analogue [18F]FDG which\ncan be used to obtain quantitative parameters concerning the metabolic\nactivity of target tissues. 18F is a cyclotron-produced radioisotope of\nfluorine that emits positrons and has a short half-life (109.7 min). It\nallows labelling of numerous molecular tracers that can be imaged\nwithin a few hours (typically <3 h) after injection. [18F]FDG is an\nanalogue of glucose and is taken up by living cells via cell membrane\nglucose transporters and subsequently incorporated into the first step of\nthe normal glycolytic pathway.\n[18F]FDG accumulation in tissue is proportional to the amount of\nglucose utilisation.

[66], assessment of liver SUL or SUV may\nbe a useful quality index of an [18F]FDG PET/CT study. Liver mea­\nsurements may be assessed by placing a spherical VOI of diameter 3 cm\nin the upper right lobe of the liver, avoiding any pathological uptake and\norgan boundaries, as indicated also in the QIBA [18F]FDG PET/CT\nprofile [33]. Liver SULs or SUVs should be reported along with lesion\nSUL or SUV data. The study protocol or clinical guidelines should define\nacceptable levels for liver SUL and required actions when specifications\nare not met. For clinical studies that are quantitatively assessed, mean\nliver SULs are expected to be within 1.0 and 2.2 (and mean liver SUVs\nwithin 1.3 and 3.0). Liver SUVs or SULs outside this range may indicate\nincorrect [18F]FDG administration or technical issues, and the use of\nquantitative analysis of the study should be reconsidered and the un­\ncertainties discussed in the study report as appropriate [92].\n19.

For pulmonary nodule assessment, it is calculated by\ndrawing several VOIs inside the thoracic aorta and measuring the\n(mean) uptake inside the vessel, taking care not to include in the VOI the\nvessel wall, where uptake can be slightly higher when there is vascular\ninflammation.

Radiation exposure to the patient\nThe absorbed radiation dose of [18F]FDG PET/CT is the combination\nof the radiation exposure from the radiopharmaceutical and the CT\nstudy. The radiation dose of diagnostic CT is a matter of concern,\nparticularly for paediatric examinations. The mean dose for a CT scan\ndepends on applications, protocols and CT systems. Especially in chil­\ndren but also in adults it is important to optimise the radiation exposure\nwith respect to the diagnostic question. Recent advances in technology\nhave allowed the radiation doses to be significantly reduced relative to a\nconventional CT or PET examination [49].\nThe coefficient for effective dose from [18F]FDG in adults is 1.7 ×\n10−2 mSv/MBq [93], i.e. about 3 mSv for an administered activity of\n185 MBq. The radiation exposure related to a CT scan carried out as part\nof an [18F]FDG PET/CT study depends on the intended use of the CT\nstudy and may differ from patient to patient: the CT scan can be a very\nlow-dose scan (with lower tube voltage and current) for attenuation\ncorrection only, or a low-dose or intermediate-dose scan for attenuation", "section": "A R T I C L E  I N F O", "page_from": 10, "page_to": 10, "display_name": "FDG", "version": "v00000000", "created_at": "2025-11-28T06:05:57", "hash": "eb524b2700917d719bec4b9f198b3a2f3baa38bee6e0c7b547b1d6b2ee54bced"}
