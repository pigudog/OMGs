O-RADS MRI assumes an average risk patient with no acute symptoms. Clinical management directed by the treating\nphysician would supersede management recommendations based on imaging alone.\n2. Categorize patient as pre- or postmenopausal (defined as ≥ 1 year amenorrhea).\n3. In case of multiple or bilateral lesions, each lesion should be separately characterized, and management will be driven\nby lesion with highest score.\n4.  Benign mature teratomas (dermoids): Characteristic benign mature teratoma (cystic lesions that contain macroscopic\nfat) may be scored as O-RADS MRI 2, due to the very low risk of malignancy. Characteristic benign mature teratomas\nmay contain septations or minimal enhancement of Rokitansky nodules and these findings do not upgrade the lesion to\nO-RADS MRI Score 4. However, fatty adnexal lesions that contain a large amount of enhancing soft tissue are classified\nas O-RADS MRI Score 4 due to risk of immature teratoma or other malignant tissue.\n5.
