Re: New Guidelines to Evaluate
the Response to Treatment in
Solid Tumors (Ovarian Cancer)
The Gynaecologic Cancer Intergroup
(GCIG) believes that deﬁnitions for re-
sponse and progression of ovarian can-
cer according to serum CA 125 levels
should be incorporated into ovarian can-
cer clinical trial protocols for relapse
therapy. Although the GCIG is con-
vinced of the value of the deﬁnition of
progression that incorporates both Re-
sponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-
mors (RECIST) and CA 125 criteria and
which should be used to deﬁne date of
progression (1,2), the response deﬁni-
tion as deﬁned by Rustin (3) could ben-
eﬁt from further simpliﬁcation. On the
basis of the available data and extensive
discussions among the cooperative groups
within the GCIG, we recommend that
the following deﬁnition of response be
used in ovarian cancer trials so that
response can be measured by either
RECIST or CA 125 criteria. If the re-
sponse is evaluable by both criteria, then
the date of response will be the date of
the earlier of the two events.
A response according to CA 125 has
occurred if there is at least a 50% reduc-
tion in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment
sample. The response must be conﬁrmed
and maintained for at least 28 days. Pa-
tients can be evaluated according to CA
125 only if they have a pretreatment sam-
ple that is at least twice the upper limit of
normal and within 2 weeks prior to start-
ing treatment.
The date when the CA 125 level is
ﬁrst reduced by 50% is the date of the
CA 125 response. To calculate CA 125
responses accurately, the following rules
apply: 1) Intervening samples and the
28-day conﬁrmatory sample must be
less than or equal to (within an assay
variability of 10%) the previous sample.
2) Variations within the normal range of
CA 125 levels will not interfere with
the response deﬁnition. We recommend
that, in an ideal situation, CA 125 mea-
surements be taken at speciﬁc time in-
tervals. The ﬁrst sample would be col-
lected within 2 weeks before treatment
is started, and later samples would be
collected at intervals of 2–4 weeks dur-
ing treatment and at intervals of every 2

or 3 months during follow-up. For each
patient, the same assay method must be
used and the assay must be tested in a
quality-control scheme. Patients are not
evaluable by CA 125 if they have re-
ceived mouse antibodies or if there has
been medical and/or surgical interfer-
ence with their peritoneum or pleura
during the previous 28 days.
This CA 125 response deﬁnition has
been produced to evaluate relapse ther-
apy. If assessing therapy that includes
two treatment modalities for relapse
(e.g., surgery and chemotherapy), any
CA 125 response results from both treat-
ments, and it should be clearly stated
that CA 125 cannot distinguish between
the effects of each treatment. To calcu-
late response rates in protocols, an
intent-to-treat analysis should be used
that includes all patients with an initial
CA 125 level of at least twice the upper
limit of normal as eligible and evalu-
able. In addition to calculating response
rates in protocols, it is advisable to
record those patients who have both a
CA 125 response and whose CA 125
level falls to within the normal range (4).
Gavin Shreeves supervised an inde-
pendent validation of this deﬁnition by
Justine Rochon for the Arbeitsgemein-
schaft
Gynaekologische
Onkologie
(AGO; Munich, Germany), Desiré Paraiso
for Group d’Investigateurs Nationaux
pour l’Etude des Cancers Ovariens
(GINECO; Paris, France), and Margot
Osinski for The Australian and New
Zealand Gynaecological Oncology
Group. An example of its use can be
seen on the Gynaecologic Cancer Inter-
group Web site (http://ctep.info.nih.gov/
