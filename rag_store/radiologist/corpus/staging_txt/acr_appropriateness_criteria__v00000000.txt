Summary of Literature Review
Introduction/Background
Ovarian cancer remains the sixth most common cause of cancer mortality in women in the United States and is a
leading cause of cancer mortality among patients with gynecologic malignancies [1]. Ovarian cancer can affect
anyone who has ovaries, including cisgender females as well as transgender men and nonbinary gender–identifying
groups who have ovaries.
There are several different histopathologic subtypes of ovarian cancer, with epithelial ovarian cancer being the most
common and accounting for approximately 90% of all malignant ovarian neoplasms [2]. Most of the information
in this document regarding imaging use for staging and recurrence applies to epithelial ovarian cancers. There are
two major subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancers that are distinguished by molecular, genetic, and morphologic
characteristics. Type I is the more indolent form that includes low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, mucinous
tumors, and clear cell carcinomas. Type II includes aggressive neoplasms, such as high-grade serous or
endometrioid, and undifferentiated cancer [3]. The aggressive, or type II ovarian cancers, typically present in
advanced stages (stage III-IV), after the disease has spread beyond the pelvis [4,5].
This document largely applies to staging and follow-up for type II ovarian cancers. Diagnostic imaging plays a
major role in characterizing ovarian mass(es), determining presurgical disease extent, predicting tumor resectability,
evaluating response to chemotherapy, and evaluating for posttreatment recurrence [2,5-11].
Although surgical staging is the reference standard in ovarian cancer, initial management recommendations rely on
presurgical imaging to assess disease extent. Pretreatment imaging can assess the likelihood of optimal primary
cytoreduction, which is the surgical removal of macroscopic disease but small sites of visible disease <1 cm in size
may remain [12]. In addition to disease extent, preoperative imaging can also identify sites of disease that are
deemed potentially unresectable or challenging to resect; for example, disease involving the small bowel mesentery
or porta hepatis and suprarenal lymph node metastases [12]. If complete or optimal cytoreduction is not felt to be
achievable, then neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be considered prior to interval debulking surgery.
Discussion of Procedures by Variant
Variant 1: Adult. Ovarian cancer. Pretreatment staging.
The goal of imaging is to appropriately stage ovarian cancer in treatment-naive patients. Imaging plays a crucial
role in guiding the most appropriate therapeutic interventions, thereby optimizing patient outcomes and overall
management of the disease.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis With IV Contrast
Contrast-enhanced CT is the most useful procedure in the preoperative evaluation of ovarian cancer [13]. It can
provide clinically relevant information, including assessment of locoregional tumor extent and distant sites of
disease including peritoneum, omentum, mesentery, liver, and lymph nodes. Contrast-enhanced CT has a reported
accuracy for ovarian cancer staging of up to 94% [14], and accurate abdominopelvic disease assessment can predict
successful surgical cytoreduction [13]. The sensitivity of CT staging varies depending on the anatomical location

Staging and Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer
being examined. One of the significant drawbacks of CT in staging ovarian cancer is its limited ability to
consistently identify tumor implants on the bowel surface, mesentery, or peritoneum that are smaller than 5 mm,
particularly in in the absence of ascites [6,15-17].
The addition of oral contrast on CT imaging, typically performed with positive oral contrast, can help differentiate
peritoneal implants from adjacent bowel. Rectal contrast administration can increase the sensitivity in detecting
rectosigmoid serosal implants [2].
CT imaging can be instrumental in planning biopsies of the omentum or other abdominopelvic tumor sites when
preoperative histology is necessary [18-21].
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous (IV)
contrast for ovarian cancer staging.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast can be considered in certain clinical settings but offers limited
ability to identify small peritoneal or mesenteric implants or lymphadenopathy from bowel or adjacent organs.
CT Chest With IV Contrast
CT of the chest with IV contrast is a useful modality for detecting pulmonary metastases during the baseline staging
of ovarian cancer. Presence of pleural metastases and pleural effusions may suggest transdiaphragmatic tumor
spread. Presence of a moderate-to-large pleural effusion on preoperative CT is a predictor of poor posttreatment
outcome and may impact decisions to pursue neoadjuvant chemotherapy over primary cytoreductive surgery [22].
CT Chest Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the chest without and with IV contrast for ovarian cancer
staging.
CT Chest Without IV Contrast
CT of the chest without IV contrast may be useful for staging evaluation. CT of the chest without IV contrast can
detect small pulmonary nodules; however, pleural metastases may be difficult to delineate without IV contrast.
FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
Fluorine-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-PET, when combined with CT, is a valuable tool for staging
advanced ovarian cancer. Although this modality has a limited role for locoregional staging, it is helpful in
identifying sites of distant metastatic disease, such as peritoneal and lymph node metastases when lesion
characterization may alter clinical management. A recent meta-analysis showed no statistical difference in
sensitivity between CT with IV contrast and FDG-PET/CT in the detection of stage III ovarian cancer; however,
there was improved specificity with FDG-PET/CT [23].
FDG-PET/MRI Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
FDG-PET, when combined with MRI, is a diagnostic alternative to more established imaging modalities, such as
contrast-enhanced CT and FDG-PET/CT, and may be useful for pretreatment staging. MRI allows for high contrast
and spatial resolution of soft tissues as compared with CT, and when paired with the functional capabilities of FDG
it may offer improved diagnostic performance compared with FDG-PET/CT [24-26]. FDG-PET/MRI can better
resolve sites of physiologic FDG activity in the pelvis (eg, pelvic ureters), distinguishing them from peritoneal
deposits, which is an advantage over FDG-PET/CT [27].
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
MRI of the abdomen and pelvis can be used for ovarian cancer staging, specifically in certain clinical settings such
as in patients with a history of fertility preservation for borderline tumors and/or inconclusive CT findings [28,29].
MRI has shown similar accuracy to CT for initial staging and has been shown to predict peritoneal tumor volume
comparable to surgery [30,31]. Limitations in the use of MRI for ovarian cancer staging include nonroutine use of
intraluminal gastrointestinal contrast agents and greater likelihood of patient motion due to examination length.
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast has a limited role in baseline ovarian cancer staging, but it can
offer better soft tissue resolution when compared with CT abdomen pelvis without IV contrast.

Staging and Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer
US Abdomen and Pelvis Transabdominal
Transabdominal ultrasound (US) of the abdomen and pelvis is not useful for pretreatment ovarian cancer staging.
A recent meta-analysis observed that although US had a good diagnostic performance in detecting disease in certain
anatomical sites (eg, rectosigmoid), it had low diagnostic performance in other anatomical sites (eg, root of the
mesentery) [32]. Although few studies have shown sensitivity comparable to that of CT [33], the use of US in
ovarian cancer staging does not reflect universal practice or experience. National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guidelines state that in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer after recent surgical procedure that
imaging with US can be used as clinically indicated [2].
US Pelvis Transvaginal
There is no relevant literature to support the use of transvaginal pelvic US for ovarian cancer staging. Transvaginal
pelvis US is helpful to determine site of origin of a pelvic mass, characterize the lesion, and assist in image-guided
core biopsy [34].
Variant 2: Adult. Ovarian cancer. Posttreatment response evaluation.
The goal of imaging is to assess the posttreatment response evaluation in ovarian cancer. With the relevant imaging
information, an appropriate clinical and follow-up plan can be determined.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis With IV Contrast
CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast is the most useful procedure to assess disease extent
following treatment [35]. NCCN guidelines state that contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis can be
performed for monitoring and follow-up of tumor burden [2].
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast for
posttreatment ovarian cancer response evaluation.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast can be considered in certain clinical settings but offers limited
ability to identify metastases, especially differentiating small peritoneal or mesenteric implants, or
lymphadenopathy from bowel or adjacent organs.
CT Chest With IV Contrast
CT of the chest with IV contrast is a useful modality to assess posttreatment response in patients with ovarian cancer
[2].
CT Chest Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the chest without and with IV contrast for posttreatment
ovarian cancer response evaluation.
CT Chest Without IV Contrast
CT of the chest without IV contrast may be considered to assess posttreatment response. CT of the chest without
IV contrast can detect small pulmonary nodules; however, pleural metastases may be difficult to delineate without
IV contrast.
FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
FDG-PET/CT may be useful in the posttreatment response evaluation of ovarian cancer [2]. Resolution or
regression of neoplastic implants with concomitant reduction in metabolic activity indicates a favorable response
to therapy.
FDG-PET/MRI Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
FDG-PET/MRI may be useful in the posttreatment response evaluation of ovarian cancer. In postoperative patients,
FDG-PET/MRI is at least equivalent to FDG-PET/CT and provides additional diagnostic benefits, such as higher
soft tissue resolution [27,36].
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be useful in the posttreatment response evaluation of ovarian cancer [2]. MRI
has comparable sensitivity and specificity to CT scans [37,38].

Staging and Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast may be considered in the posttreatment response evaluation of
ovarian cancer and may offer improved soft tissue contrast compared with CT without IV contrast.
US Abdomen and Pelvis Transabdominal
There is no relevant literature to support the use of transabdominal US of the abdomen and pelvis in evaluating
posttreatment response.
US Pelvis Transvaginal
There is no relevant literature to support the use of transvaginal US of the pelvis for the evaluation of posttreatment
response.
Variant 3: Adult. Ovarian cancer. Posttreatment routine surveillance. Asymptomatic patient, no suspected
recurrence.
The goal of imaging is to identify disease recurrence in asymptomatic patients on surveillance with a history of
treated ovarian cancer. With the relevant imaging information, early and unexpected recurrence can be identified,
thus improving patient outcomes.
The role for routine surveillance with imaging is unclear in patients considered to be in clinical remission. Imaging
has limited sensitivity for the detection of small tumor deposits in the abdomen and pelvis, with or without
monitoring of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) levels [4,39]. NCCN guidelines for follow-up after primary treatment
includes scheduled clinical visits, imaging when clinically indicated (CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis; MRI;
FDG-PET/CT; or PET), and CA-125 monitoring if initial elevation was present [2].
Surveillance imaging may be warranted in asymptomatic patients under circumstances in which tumor markers are
deemed unreliable, physical examinations are inconclusive, or there is a significant risk of recurrence [2].
The patient population defined in this scenario is an asymptomatic patient in whom no recurrence is suspected (eg,
no concerning physical examination findings and no elevation of serum tumor markers).
CT Abdomen and Pelvis With IV Contrast
The use of surveillance with CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is unclear in those patients considered
to be in clinical remission. In one study with CT surveillance, a higher rate of optimal secondary cytoreductive
surgery and improved overall survival was reported in those with asymptomatic recurrences compared with patients
with symptomatic recurrences [38,40]. However, in another study of 412 patients, recurrence in 80% of the patient
population was detected by either physical examination (15%), imaging (27%), CA-125 level (23%), or CA-125
level combined with imaging (35%) [4,38]. In this same study, no difference in overall survival was shown between
asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with recurrence.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast in
asymptomatic patients without suspected recurrence.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
In instances for which CT of the abdomen and pelvis is clinically indicated, CT of the abdomen and pelvis without
IV contrast may be considered in some clinical instances.
CT Chest With IV Contrast
Surveillance with CT of the chest with IV contrast is unclear in patients without suspected recurrence. Per NCCN
guidelines, CT of the chest may be considered as part of monitoring and follow-up, as clinically useful [2].
CT Chest Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the chest without and with IV contrast in asymptomatic
patients without suspected recurrence.
CT Chest Without IV Contrast
The utility of surveillance imaging is unclear in those patients considered to be in clinical remission. Per NCCN
guidelines, CT of the chest may be considered as part of monitoring and follow-up, as clinically indicated [2].
FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
The use of surveillance FDG-PET/CT is unclear in those patients considered to be in clinical remission. Per NCCN
guidelines, PET/CT or PET may be considered as part of monitoring and follow-up, as clinically indicated [2].

MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
Per NCCN guidelines, MRI may be considered as part of monitoring and follow-up for patients with ovarian cancer
in the posttreatment routine surveillance setting, as clinically indicated [2]. As such, MRI of the abdomen without
and with IV contrast may be useful.
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
Per NCCN guidelines, MRI may be considered as part of monitoring and follow-up for patients with ovarian cancer
in the posttreatment routine surveillance setting, as clinically indicated [2]. As such, MRI of the abdomen and pelvis
without IV contrast may be useful.
US Abdomen and Pelvis Transabdominal
There is no evidence to support the use of transabdominal US of the abdomen and pelvis for posttreatment
surveillance in asymptomatic patients.
US Pelvis Transvaginal
There is no evidence to support the use of transvaginal US of the pelvis for posttreatment surveillance in
asymptomatic patients with a history of treated ovarian cancer.
Variant 4: Adult. Ovarian cancer. Posttreatment evaluation. Suspected or known recurrence.
The goal of imaging is to identify sites of disease recurrence in patients with a history of treated ovarian cancer with
suspected or known recurrence. The relevant imaging information can inform treatment planning and specifically
guide decisions related to surgical or medical treatment.
In the evaluation for recurrence and extent of disease, imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis plays a key role.
The suspicion of recurrence after treatment may arise from clinical symptoms, findings during physical
examination, or an increase in CA-125 levels, which would then prompt the need for imaging to evaluate for
recurrence.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis With IV Contrast
CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast is the most useful procedure for confirming recurrent
disease and determining the extent in patients with suspected or known recurrence (based on clinical symptoms,
physical examination, or CA-125 level) [38]. Contrast-enhanced CT has a reported sensitivity ranging from 58% to
84% and a specificity in the range of 59% to 100% in identifying tumor recurrence [41-43]. Recurrent disease often
presents as peritoneal implants, both within the peritoneal cavity and along the surface of visceral organs. A
limitation with CT is detecting peritoneal, mesenteric, or serosal lesions that are <5 mm in size [40].
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast in
the evaluation of suspected or known ovarian cancer recurrence.
CT Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
CT of the abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast offers limited ability to identify small peritoneal or mesenteric
implants, or lymphadenopathy among bowel loops and other adjacent organs.
CT Chest With IV Contrast
CT of the chest with IV contrast is the most useful modality in evaluating recurrent or metastatic disease in the
thorax.
CT Chest Without and With IV Contrast
There is no relevant literature to support the use of CT of the chest without and with IV contrast in the evaluation
of suspected or known ovarian cancer recurrence.
CT Chest Without IV Contrast
CT of the chest without IV contrast is not typically useful in this setting.
FDG-PET/CT Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
FDG-PET/CT can be used in the evaluation of recurrent ovarian cancer [2]. In a recent meta-analysis, FDG-PET/CT
showed a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 89% in diagnosing recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer [44]. FDG-

Staging and Follow-up of Ovarian Cancer
PET/CT can also be used as an adjunct imaging study when there is a high clinical suspicion for recurrence but CT
is indeterminate [45]. Certain limitations of FDG-PET/CT including poor detection of subcentimeter metastases
due to suboptimal spatial resolution of PET, high concentration of excreted FDG obscuring lesions near the bladder,
and metabolic activity on or between bowel loops, particularly after surgery when adhesions or inflammation are
present, may be difficult to assess [44,45].
FDG-PET/MRI Skull Base to Mid-Thigh
In specific patient scenarios, FDG-PET/MRI may be useful in the suspected recurrence. Example scenarios include
those patients with high clinical suspicion (such as rising CA-125 levels or worsening clinical symptoms) but
indeterminate CT findings [27].
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without and With IV Contrast
MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be useful as a problem-solving tool in those patients with suspected or known
disease recurrence and when CT is indeterminate.
MRI Abdomen and Pelvis Without IV Contrast
MRI without IV contrast may be considered in those patients with suspected or known disease recurrence of ovarian
cancer and when CT is indeterminate. However, IV contrast is preferable for the detection and characterization of
lesions suspected to represent tumor deposits.
US Abdomen and Pelvis Transabdominal
There is no relevant literature to support the use of transabdominal US of the abdomen and pelvis in the evaluation
of suspected or known ovarian cancer recurrence.
US Pelvis Transvaginal
There is no relevant literature to support the routine use of pelvic US in the evaluation of suspected or known
ovarian cancer recurrence following treatment.
Summary of Highlights
This is a summary of the key recommendations from the variant tables. Refer to the complete narrative document
for more information.
•
Variant 1: For initial pretreatment staging of ovarian cancer, CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast and CT
chest with IV contrast are recommended complementary studies to stage the tumor and evaluate for distant
metastases. MRI abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast, MRI abdomen and pelvis without IV
contrast, CT abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, CT chest without IV contrast, FDG-PET/MRI, and FDG-
PET/CT may be appropriate in staging ovarian cancer prior to treatment.
•
Variant 2: For follow-up imaging evaluation following treatment for ovarian cancer, CT abdomen and pelvis
with IV contrast, CT chest with IV contrast, and FDG-PET/CT are recommended complementary studies to
evaluate the posttreatment response. MRI abdomen and pelvis without and with IV contrast, MRI abdomen and
pelvis without IV contrast, CT abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, CT chest without IV contrast, and FDG-
PET/MRI may be appropriate in the posttreatment response evaluation.
•
Variant 3: For posttreatment imaging evaluation in asymptomatic patients without suspected recurrence, the
role of imaging is unclear in those patients considered to be in clinical remission. CT abdomen and pelvis with
or without IV contrast, CT chest with or without IV contrast, MRI abdomen and pelvis without and with IV
contrast, MR abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, FDG-PET/MRI, and FDG-PET/CT may be appropriate,
as clinically indicated.
•
Variant 4: For follow-up imaging evaluation following treatment for ovarian cancer in patients with suspected
or known recurrence, CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, CT chest with IV contrast, and FDG-PET/CT
are recommended complementary studies to evaluate for local recurrence and metastatic disease. MRI abdomen
and pelvis without and with IV contrast, MRI abdomen and pelvis without IV contrast, CT abdomen and pelvis
without IV contrast, CT chest without IV contrast, and FDG-PET/MRI may be appropriate in the posttreatment
evaluation of patients with suspected or known recurrence.

Relative Radiation Level Information
Potential adverse health effects associated with radiation exposure are an important factor to consider when
selecting the appropriate imaging procedure. Because there is a wide range of radiation exposures associated with
different diagnostic procedures, a relative radiation level (RRL) indication has been included for each imaging
examination. The RRLs are based on effective dose, which is a radiation dose quantity that is used to estimate
population total radiation risk associated with an imaging procedure. Patients in the pediatric age group are at
inherently higher risk from exposure, because of both organ sensitivity and longer life expectancy (relevant to the
long latency that appears to accompany radiation exposure). For these reasons, the RRL dose estimate ranges for
pediatric examinations are lower as compared with those specified for adults (see Table below). Additional
information regarding radiation dose assessment for imaging examinations can be found in the ACR
Appropriateness Criteria® Radiation Dose Assessment Introduction document [47].
