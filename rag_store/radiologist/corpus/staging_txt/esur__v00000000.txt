Abstract
Objective To provide up-to-date European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) guidelines for staging and follow-
up of patients with ovarian cancer (OC).
Methods Twenty-one experts, members of the female pelvis imaging ESUR subcommittee from 19 institutions,
replied to 2 rounds of questionnaires regarding imaging techniques and structured reporting used for pre-treatment
evaluation of OC patients. The results of the survey were presented to the other authors during the group’s annual
meeting. The lexicon was aligned with the Society of American Radiology (SAR)-ESUR lexicon; a ﬁrst draft was
circulated, and then comments and suggestions from the other authors were incorporated.
Results Evaluation of disease extent at diagnosis should be performed by chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT. The
radiological report should map the disease with speciﬁc mention of sites that may preclude optimal cytoreductive
surgery. For suspected recurrence, CT and [18F]FDG PET-CT are both valid options. MRI can be considered in
experienced centres, as an alternative to CT, considering the high costs and the need for higher expertise in reporting.
Conclusions CT is the imaging modality of choice for preoperative evaluation and follow-up in OC patients. A
structured radiological report, including speciﬁc mention of sites that may preclude optimal debulking, is of value for
patient management.
Key Points
Question Guidelines were last published for ovarian cancer (OC) imaging in 2010; here, guidance on imaging techniques
and reporting, incorporating advances in the ﬁeld, are provided.
Findings Structured reports should map out sites of disease, highlighting sites that limit cytoreduction. For suspected
recurrence, CT and 18FDG PET-CT are options, and MRI can be considered.
Clinical relevance Imaging evaluation of OC patients at initial diagnosis (mainly based on CT), using a structured report
that considers surgical needs is valuable in treatment selection and planning.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer (OC) is the leading cause of death from
gynaecologic malignancies, with an observed number of
deaths in the EU in 2017 of 26.221 and a prediction of
26.500 deaths in 2022 [1].
The ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer
are considered a single entity (referred to as OC for sim-
plicity) because of the similar staging, management, and
prognosis. The International Federation of Gynaecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) system, last revised in 2014, is mostly used
for staging these cancers and relies on surgical exploration to
determine the stage [2]. High-grade serous carcinoma is the
most common histologic subtype of OC, and most patients
present with advanced-stage disease at diagnosis [3].
Currently, the mainstay of OC treatment is based on
upfront surgery (complete cytoreduction), and a platinum-
based combination chemotherapy [3]. The aim of surgery is
complete (or at least optimal) cytoreduction. A thorough
staging surgery allows for diagnosis, staging, treatment, and
assessment of the overall prognosis [4]. The results of the
prospective multi-centre randomised Trial of Radical
Upfront Surgical Therapy in advanced ovarian cancer
(TRUST) are anticipated by the end of 2024. This study is
expected to clarify the optimal timing of cytoreductive
surgery by comparing outcomes of primary cytoreductive
surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy versus neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreductive
surgery [5]. In the meantime, optimal primary treatment
selection is best achieved through multidisciplinary colla-
boration between gynaecologic surgical oncologists, med-
ical oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists.
Pre-operative imaging delineates disease extent and facil-
itates multidisciplinary treatment planning. This includes
assessing the feasibility of upfront surgery, determining the
need for intra-operative support from other surgical spe-
cialties, estimating operative time, and guiding biopsies if
upfront cytoreduction is not feasible. According to the
ESGO-ESMO-ESP recommendations, pre-operative ima-
ging with contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, and [18F]FDG PET-
CT, with a structured radiological report, may be considered
for the initial evaluation of patients with advanced ovarian
carcinoma, with a level of evidence IIIA [3].
The European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR)
published its guidelines for OC imaging in 2010 [6]. The
purpose of this update is to provide radiologists with
comprehensive guidance on imaging techniques and
reporting for OC patients prior to treatment and during
follow-up, incorporating recent advances in the ﬁeld.
These guidelines do not cover the assessment and
characterisation of ovarian masses, which are addressed
by other ESUR guidelines and by the Ovarian-Adnexal
Reporting And Data System (O-RADS) US and O-RADS
MRI risk stratiﬁcation systems [7–9].
Methods
Literature search and questionnaire
The updating process has been implemented with the
following steps:
Step 1: After reviewing the literature, three authors (S.R.,
S.N., R.F.) designed a questionnaire regarding imaging
techniques used for the pre-treatment evaluation of OC.
Step 2: A structured questionnaire of 87 questions was
designed, and the questions focused on imaging techni-
ques (CT, MRI, [18F]FDG PET-CT) used for staging and
follow-up in OC patients.
Step 3: The questionnaire was administered via an
electronic link to all ESUR Female Pelvic Imaging working
group members in November 2023.
Step 4: All responses were collected on a dedicated
survey platform, analysed by four authors (G.A., S.R., S.N.,
R.F.), and presented during the ESUR Female Pelvic
Imaging working group at the annual European Congress
of Radiology Meeting in March 2024.
Step 5: To address contradictory responses provided by
the participants, a secondary questionnaire was sent either
to reach a consensus or for questions raised as open
questions in the ﬁrst round.
Step 6: All the answers were lastly analysed by ﬁve authors
(G.A., S.R., C.P., S.N., R.F.). Each item was categorised as
recommended if there was > 80% agreement among experts
or optional if such agreement was not reached.
Structured report
The proposal of a structured report was adapted accord-
ing to the survey results. The survey included the ESUR
lexicon [6], and during the elaboration of the paper, it was
aligned with the SAR-ESUR lexicon [10].
Paper preparation
The main authors prepared a ﬁrst draft of the guidelines,
incorporating all the relevant information raised by the
questionnaires, during the ECR annual and online meet-
ings. They then circulated the manuscript among all
authors for comments and suggestions.
Results
The panel (i.e., responders to both surveys) comprised 21
experts in the ﬁeld of gynaecological oncology imaging

from 19 institutions, including 15 European Centres
(Austria (n = 2), France (n = 3), Germany (n = 1), Italy
(n = 2), Portugal (n = 2), Spain (n = 1), Switzerland
(n = 2), and UK (n = 2) and 4 institutions situated
outside Europe, Japan (n = 1) Uruguay (n = 1) and USA
(n = 2). The years of training ranged from 5–20 years of
experience after fellowship.
Recommendations
The recommendations cover indications and techniques
to use for pre-treatment evaluation and follow-up, tech-
nical parameters, standardised reports, and future per-
spectives. The main results for recommendations are
summarised in Table 1.
Details on CT and MRI protocols are included in the
supplementary materials (Supplementary Table 1).
Structured radiological reporting
Over 80% consensus was reached for organ-based struc-
tured reporting. The lexicon was aligned to the SAR-
ESUR lexicon for consistency, as shown in Table 2. A
table highlighting the differences between the 2010 and
2024 guidelines is included in the supplementary mate-
rials (Supplementary Table 2). For lymph node metastases
deﬁnition, the 2020 guidelines [6] and the node-RADS
were referred to [11]. Internal mammary lymph nodes
that were not mentioned in the node-RADS were inclu-
ded with the cardio-phrenic and retrocrural lymph nodes
for size reference.
No consensus was reached regarding the inclusion of the
FIGO stage nor the use of surgical scores in the imaging
report, such as the peritoneal cancer index [12], Fagotti
score [13], or others. Furthermore, no consensus was
reached about the use of RECIST criteria in the structured
report, as these are mainly reserved for patients who are
enrolled in clinical trials to monitor treatment response [14].
Sites that may preclude optimal cytoreduction
The criteria for sites of disease that may preclude optimal
cytoreduction may differ between centres, depending on
the surgical expertise, patient’s performance status, mor-
bidity of surgery, and intensive care facilities [15].
The radiological report should pay special attention to
these sites to provide complete, clear, and relevant
information
for
treatment
decisions
by
the
multi-
disciplinary team. The main sites that may preclude
complete optimal cytoreduction [3, 15] and require spe-
ciﬁc mention in the report are summarised in Table 3, and
some of them are represented in Figs. 1–5. In contrast to
the 2010 published guidelines, the 2 cm diameter for
difﬁcult-to-resect sites is no longer considered valid [6].
Furthermore, criteria for patients who are not candidates
for primary surgery [15] have been included.

cases where the US is inconclusive, MRI serves as the
second-line technique for lesion characterisation, with

effectiveness, and utility in the follow-up, providing con-
sistent and reproducible results [18]. The portal venous
phase is the recommended contrast phase for this pur-
pose. To ensure high accuracy, CT should be performed
using a multislice CT scanner, and multiplanar recon-
structions should be reviewed to increase conﬁdence in
interpreting the scans [19].
A signiﬁcant update to the guidelines is the recom-
mendation to include chest CT for complete staging. It
provides
crucial
information
about
potential
extra-
abdominal disease, impacting treatment planning. Nota-
bly, the CT protocol does not require speciﬁc preparation,
such as fasting, oral contrast administration, or spasmo-
lytic drugs [20]. Indeed, none of these preparations
reached consensus.
The present updated ESUR guidelines recommend a CT
scan as the initial evaluation for patients with advanced
OC before debulking surgery, with the option to choose a
combination of chest CT and MRI abdomen and pelvis as
a valid alternative when iodine contrast media cannot be
administered and in pregnant women. A speciﬁc question
to the experts’ panel on pre-operative evaluation of young
patients did not reach consensus about the imaging
technique (i.e., not performing CT and only MRI) to use,
therefore it can be adapted to the single centre’s pre-
ference and experience [21].
When used for pre-treatment evaluation, abdominal
MRI should include T1- and T2-weighted imaging and
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the abdomen and
pelvis, with the administration of a spasmolytic drug, to
minimise motion artefacts. Gadolinium-based contrast
agents can be used to complete evaluation. The use of
pineapple juice has been proposed as an adjunct to
minimise the hyper T2 effect of the bowel lumen (Sup-
plementary Table 1). MRI protocol may be adjusted based
on the indication of the exam.
Whole-body (WB)-MRI may be considered for a site-
based analysis of sub-centimetre lesions, where DWI

sequences, combined with morphological sequences, may
outperform CT [22] and [18F]FDG PET-CT [23] to detect
challenging to resect sites, such as serosal and mesenteric
involvement. However, this technique is less available,
more expensive, longer, and thus harder for patients.
Furthermore, it requires a lot more expertise to perform
and interpret appropriately. Therefore, more studies
should be performed to conﬁrm WB-MRI superiority
compared to the other techniques, before its imple-
mentation in the clinical routine, especially over abdom-
inal and pelvic MRI.
[18F]FDG PET-CT has a limited role in the initial eva-
luation of patients with OC and is not recommended as a
ﬁrst-line imaging technique. Indeed, [18F]FDG PET-CT
cannot differentiate reliably between borderline and
benign tumours; it may fail to detect clear cell and
mucinous invasive subtypes due to low FDG uptake as
well as give false positive results in the presence
of endometriosis and hydrosalpinxes [24, 25]. Although
[18F]FDG PET-CT may be as accurate as CT in predicting
the presence of chest metastasis, it fails to detect small
peritoneal metastases [26], therefore its role in initial
evaluation is limited to the evaluation or conﬁrmation of
possible extraperitoneal spread of disease. On the other
hand, [18F]FDG PET-CT may be valuable in evaluating
ambiguous extra-abdominal ﬁndings, such as extra-
abdominal lymph nodes [27], that could inﬂuence treat-
ment decisions.
Follow-up and recurrence
Post-treatment surveillance of OC typically involves a
combination of clinical examination, routine CA-125
blood tests, and periodic imaging. There is currently no
standardised clinical recommendation for imaging fre-
quency, and radiological imaging may be indicated
according to histology of the tumour, symptoms, clinical
examination or rising of CA-125 level, or other markers
[15]. The crucial issue is to perform the same imaging
modality each time to be able to compare. Still, CT scans
are commonly performed at intervals of three to six
months or when recurrence is suspected based on clinical
or laboratory ﬁndings [15].
Indeed our survey indicated that CT remains the pri-
mary imaging modality for follow-up and assessment of
treatment response. The CT protocol for follow-up is the
same as for evaluation at diagnosis.
To date, not enough studies have evaluated the role of
MRI in terms of follow up and recurrence, therefore these
guidelines cannot give any recommendation about its use
during follow-up. However, the use of MRI for follow-up
could be discussed in multidisciplinary teams for young
patients to save radiation exposure.
[18F]FDG PET-CT may be beneﬁcial in cases where CA-
125 levels are elevated, but CT is negative. [18F]FDG PET-
CT may also help detect persistent disease and notice
distant sites when planning a secondary cytoreductive
surgery [28]. Indeed, results of a retrospective multi-
centric trial demonstrated improved progression-free
survival and a longer time to ﬁrst subsequent therapy in
OC patients that, at ﬁrst recurrence, underwent secondary
cytoreductive surgery, with no residual disease [29].
Structured report
The use of a structured report for the pre-treatment evalua-
tion of OC using CT or MRI is recommended [10, 30, 31],
since it enhances uniformity in disease reporting and
improves communication between radiologists and clinicians,
potentially leading to better treatment choice and surgical
planning and hence optimal patient care. This is particularly
relevant as not all lesions are clearly visible at laparoscopy
(behind the upper part of the liver, for example) and need to
be removed if a primary surgery is decided.
A structured radiological report should provide com-
prehensive information about the primary tumour and its
dissemination in the peritoneal cavity, the presence of
lymph node enlargement, parenchymal involvement of
thoracic,
abdominal,
and
pelvic
organs,
and
extra-
abdominal tumour spreading. A study including 205
reports showed that the implementation of a synoptic
report at the initial CT evaluation of patients with
advanced OC, improved the overall documentation rate of
disease extent from 39% for simple structured reports to
99% for synoptic reports and unresectable or challenging-
to-resect sites from 37% to 100%, respectively [32].
The expert panel advises an organ-based disease
description with detailed mapping of the peritoneal sites
in the radiological report. The recommended structured
report essential items are summarised in Table 2.
Compared to the 2010 guidelines [6], a description of
vascular variants (such as the position of the left renal vein
compared to the aorta) is now recommended to help
surgeons
avoid
complications
during
lymph
node
dissection.
The deﬁnition of lymph nodes as metastatic has reached
consensus, indicating positive lymph nodes in general
with a short axis ≥10 mm, except for cardio-phrenic,
retrocrural, and internal mammary lymph nodes, con-
sidered positive with a short axis ≥5 mm, and of inguinal
lymph nodes considered positive with a short axis
≥15 mm [11]. Although different short axis sizes have
been described in multiple papers [10, 33], in these
guidelines, intended also for general practice radiologists,
the expert panel decided to keep it simple and to adopt
the node-RADS size criteria, that align with the 2010
guidelines
[6,
11].
However,

multidisciplinary meeting may be helpful about the sig-
niﬁcance
of
slightly
enlarged
extra-abdominal
lymph nodes.
The inclusion of the FIGO/TNM classiﬁcation, perito-
neal cancer index, or other scores did not reach > 80%
agreement. The gynaecological surgeons make the deci-
sion on how far a cytoreductive surgery can go, con-
sidering the patient’s performance status and disease-
related factors, together with imaging evaluation of the
disease extension. For this reason, the imaging criteria for
sites that may preclude optimal cytoreduction in OC
should always be discussed and approved in a multi-
disciplinary meeting [34]. There are also some locations
indicating that patients may not be candidates for primary
surgery, and these should be described in the report and
possibly discussed during a multidisciplinary meeting.
Compared to the 2010 guidelines, the cut-off of 2 cm for the
peritoneal supra-mesocolic and small bowel peritoneal
metastases did not reach consensus and have been removed.
Potential implementations in the future
Although not included in the recommendations of these
guidelines, aimed at a practical approach, technological
and computational developments that are underway are
here mentioned, as they may have already a role in few
centres or may be more spread out in the future.
PET-MRI
Combined PET-MRI has been available for clinical use
since 2010; however, the number of installed PET-MRI
systems is still small compared to clinical [18F]FDG
PET-CT systems [24]. Today, PET-MRI is primarily
performed for oncological indications. Still, its adoption
has been challenged by the lack of protocol, workﬂow
standardisation [24], and reimbursement, which is often
non-existent or variable between countries [35]. Given
the challenges of standardisation and harmonisation of
MRI data acquisition, a clinical trial comparing this
imaging modality to the existing ones is considered
difﬁcult to achieve. For this reason, a PET-MRI registry
for pooling data acquired at multiple centres was cre-
ated. In the speciﬁc clinical setting of OC, [18F]FDG
PET-CT, and PET-MRI demonstrated accuracy rates of
71% and 92.5% in the peritoneal staging and character-
isation of suspected OC [36]. In a group of 34 patients,
PET-MRI was more accurate than DW-MRI (p = 0.001)
when evaluating patients at primary diagnosis, although
no difference was noted in patients treated with che-
motherapy. In the small bowel regions, there was a
tendency towards higher sensitivity but lower speciﬁcity
of PET-MRI compared to DW-MRI. Few published
studies suggest the high diagnostic potential of PET-
MRI for the assessment of the recurrence of female
pelvic malignancies and higher diagnostic conﬁdence in
discrimination between benign and malignant lesions
compared to [18F]FDG PET-CT [37]. In the future,
further studies are suggested, possibly randomised and
prospective, to assess the added value of the PET-MRI
imaging modality.
Artiﬁcial intelligence/radiomics
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science,
refers to the ability of computer systems to learn from
input data. AI is playing an essential role in many different
areas of imaging. In recent years, AI-based multi-omics
research has been widely conducted with a focus on OC
[38]. Radiomics is part of the AI non-invasive approaches
that aim to create prediction models by extracting
quantitative features from medical images through spe-
ciﬁc steps, such as image acquisition, segmentation, fea-
ture extraction, and model construction [39]. Although
many issues need to be addressed, primarily related to the
quality of the studies and the possibility of routine clinical
applications
of
predictive
radiomic
signatures
[40],
radiomics raises particular hope in OC to capture the
whole disease heterogeneity better and offer a new tool to
predict tumour aggressiveness, response to therapy and
survival [41–45]. Furthermore, studies addressing the
advances in research on molecular targeted therapies and
how they may be reﬂected by imaging would be of great
help in the future. The future of radiomics clinical
application may rely on large multicentric studies, always
including appropriate validation cohorts to ensure the
reproducibility of models and performed according to
high-quality standards [46].
In conclusion, the ESUR Female Imaging working group
has updated the guidelines for imaging of patients with
OC, recommending contrast-enhanced chest, abdominal,
and pelvic CT for pre-treatment evaluation and follow-up.
A structured report, including all sites of disease reported
according to the SAR-ESUR lexicon, has been introduced;
the sites of disease that may preclude an optimal cytor-
eduction are highlighted to pay special attention to them
when reporting the CT exam and presenting the results to
the multidisciplinary meetings, where the decision on
primary debulking or interval debulking surgery should be
undertaken.
