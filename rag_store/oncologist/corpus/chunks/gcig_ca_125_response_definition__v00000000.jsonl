Although the GCIG is con-\nvinced of the value of the deﬁnition of\nprogression that incorporates both Re-\nsponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-\nmors (RECIST) and CA 125 criteria and\nwhich should be used to deﬁne date of\nprogression (1,2), the response deﬁni-\ntion as deﬁned by Rustin (3) could ben-\neﬁt from further simpliﬁcation. On the\nbasis of the available data and extensive\ndiscussions among the cooperative groups\nwithin the GCIG, we recommend that\nthe following deﬁnition of response be\nused in ovarian cancer trials so that\nresponse can be measured by either\nRECIST or CA 125 criteria. If the re-\nsponse is evaluable by both criteria, then\nthe date of response will be the date of\nthe earlier of the two events.\nA response according to CA 125 has\noccurred if there is at least a 50% reduc-\ntion in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment", "section": "Re: New Guidelines to Evaluate", "page_from": 1, "page_to": 1, "display_name": "GCIG CA 125 Response Definition", "version": "v00000000", "created_at": "2025-11-28T06:04:58", "hash": "e913ef1fbb4fa2ec36109d6ecb8b2f425dea9f5e367987221261aece151f8d58"}
