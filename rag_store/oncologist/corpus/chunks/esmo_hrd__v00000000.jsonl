The standard treatment regimen typically includes\ncarboplatin and paclitaxel, with the addition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for patients with high-grade\nserous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. However, the variability in treatment responses\nsuggests the need to investigate factors beyond BRCA1/2 mutations, such as DNA repair mechanisms and epigenetic\nalterations. Notably, homologous recombination repair deﬁciency (HRD) is observed in an additional 20% of HGSOC\ncases, indicating a broader spectrum of DNA repair defects. Existing commercial HRD assays have certain limitations,\nprompting a global effort to develop new genomic and functional tests through academic research.\nMaterials and methods: This study investigates, in the 187 high-grade serous and endometrioid tumors from the\nMITO16/MaNGO-OV-2 trial, academic HRD genomic tests in conjunction with a RAD51 immunoﬂuorescence assay to", "section": "ORIGINAL ARTICLE", "page_from": 1, "page_to": 1, "display_name": "esmo_hrd", "version": "v00000000", "created_at": "2025-11-28T06:04:58", "hash": "b34d8e67f920ac6777146104e4027479020920ef06f00efd5cbcf95de5d8ce7d"}
