Background: Ovarian cancer (OvC) constitutes signiﬁcant management challenges primarily due to its late-stage
diagnosis and the development of resistance to chemotherapy. The standard treatment regimen typically includes
carboplatin and paclitaxel, with the addition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for patients with high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) harboring BRCA1/2 mutations. However, the variability in treatment responses
suggests the need to investigate factors beyond BRCA1/2 mutations, such as DNA repair mechanisms and epigenetic
alterations. Notably, homologous recombination repair deﬁciency (HRD) is observed in an additional 20% of HGSOC
cases, indicating a broader spectrum of DNA repair defects. Existing commercial HRD assays have certain limitations,
prompting a global effort to develop new genomic and functional tests through academic research.
Materials and methods: This study investigates, in the 187 high-grade serous and endometrioid tumors from the
MITO16/MaNGO-OV-2 trial, academic HRD genomic tests in conjunction with a RAD51 immunoﬂuorescence assay to
assess functional activation of HRD. Additionally, the study incorporates analysis of microRNA-506 (miR-506)
expression as a putative epigenetic effector.
Results: The RAD51 test identiﬁed HRD in 73% of the samples and genomic HRD testing in 57%, with HRD identiﬁed in
45% of samples by both tests. The signiﬁcant discrepancy between the two assays emphasizes the need to reﬁne tumor
classiﬁcation for HRD. A three-group genomic classiﬁcation unveiled superior progression-free survival (PFS) in high-
and mild-HRD tumors compared with negative-HRD tumors. High concordance between RAD51 and genomic testing
in high-HRD tumors suggests a subset of ‘super-HRD’ tumors exhibiting superior PFS. High expression of miR-506
may be used to further reﬁne HRD status.
Conclusions: The study underscores the complexities of HRD assessment and advocates for a combined genomic and
functional approach to enhance predictive accuracy in OvC treatment responses.

of carboplatin and paclitaxel. However, the heterogeneity of
treatment response among patients prompts the explora-
tion of additional predictive biomarkers of response/resis-
tance such as impairment in DNA repair mechanisms and
epigenetic changes.2 Data coming from The Cancer Genome
Atlas analysis have clearly shown that w30% of the patients
with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) carry a
germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/
2) genes, involved in the homologous recombination repair
(HRR) pathway. These patients present better prognosis,
higher response to platinum and better outcome after
maintenance treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
inhibitors (PARPi). It has been commonly recognized that
HRR deﬁciency (HRD) is not restricted to patients with
BRCA1/2
mutations.
Other
mutations
and
epigenetic
changes in HRR genes account for a further 20% of HRD in
HGSOC.3
The efﬁcacy of niraparib and rucaparib has been docu-
mented in ﬁrst line also for ‘all-comers’ patients, although
better response is observed for BRCA1/2-mutated and HRD
patients.4,5 Nonetheless, several HRR-proﬁcient (HRP) pa-
tients do respond to platinum and PARPi raising the ques-
tion of a better understanding of the biology and better
testing to predict the response to treatment.4,6
The myChoice CDx assay by Myriad Genetics was the ﬁrst
commercially available HRD assay, assessing mutations in
BRCA1/2 genes and genomic instability patterns topically
developed by HRD tumors.7 The assay combines the results
of three molecular parameters, expressed as the sum of loss
of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance and
large-scale state transitions.7 The deﬁnitions of HRD posi-
tivity varied between the trials.7 All trials used an HRD score
cut-off of 42 to deﬁne HRD status, but as the methodol-
ogy for cut-off selection has not been shown, the test is
considered poorly reproducible, and the deﬁnition of an
unequivocal score value is far to be achieved.4,6,7 The
Foundation Medicine CDxBRCA is another test detecting
BRCA1/2 mutations and assessing the percentage of the
genome affected by LOH.8 Tumors are considered to be
HRD if the LOH score is 16.8
Many other genomic tests have been recently developed
and proved to be able to predict response to PARPi with
similar efﬁcacy than the myChoice CDx assay by Myriad
Genetics.2 Despite their efﬁcacy, these commercial tests
have limitations, including ‘unknown’ status (i.e. tumors for
which the test was unable to provide a deﬁnitive determi-
nation of the HRD status), false negatives and high costs.2
Furthermore, these tests are static and do not catch the
dynamic evolution of the sensitivity to treatment.2,9 New
genomic and functional academic tests are being developed
globally to overcome these limitations.
In the preliminary experience from our group, we
investigated two academic genomic tests to assess the HRD
status and combined these with the RAD51 assay to eval-
uate the functional activation of the HRR pathway.10 The
performance of our academic HRD test has been recently
conﬁrmed in an independent cohort of patients using two
different pipelines for shallow whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) compared with the myChoice CDx assay.11
In this paper, we further explore this concept increasing
the sample size and combining also with other putative
epigenetic
effectors such
as
microRNA-506
(miR-506)
whose overexpression in cellular models impairs RAD51 foci
formation following induction of DNA damage, increasing
cell line sensitivity to platinum salts and PARPi,12,13 and
correlates to better prognosis in OvC patients.12
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This study is part of the translational activities associated
with the MITO16A/MaNGO-OV2 (EudraCT number: 2012-
003043-29, hereafter indicated as MITO16A) clinical trial,
coordinated by the Clinical Trials Unit at Istituto Nazionale
Tumori IRCCS “Fondazione G. Pascale” in Naples. MITO16A
is a phase IV trial that aims to explore the prognostic role
of selected biomarkers in epithelial ovarian cancer pat-
ients treated in ﬁrst line with chemotherapy (paclitaxel þ
carboplatin  6) plus bevacizumab (BEV) (15 mg/kg) for
15 months. Overall, 398 patients were prospectively
enrolled.14
Sample collection and processing
MITO16A samples have been collected and processed in the
coordinating center. A 5-mm section was cut from each
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) block, stained with
hematoxylineeosin and reviewed by a trained gynecologic
pathologist. For the current analysis, 187 samples of all
available high-grade serous and endometrioid samples with
available DNA and FFPE blocks were selected for the dedi-
cated analyses.
Extraction of total nucleic acids was carried out as
described.15 Brieﬂy, extraction of genomic DNA from FFPE
tissues was carried out from two cores of parafﬁn-
embedded tissues using the GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit
(Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was extracted from two
1-mm cores of FFPE tissues using the QIAGEN miRNeasy
FFPE Kit. RNA concentration was assessed using the
NanoDrop
2000
UV-Vis
spectrophotometer
(Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA) and samples with RNA con-
centration <80 ng/ml were excluded from the study.
Sample purity and RNA integrity were evaluated as
described.15 For 140 out of 187 patients, miRNA expres-
sion proﬁles were also available (see following section).
The institutional review boards of the involved institutions
have approved the study design. All patients provided
informed consent to the use of their data for research
purposes before enrolment.

Immunoﬂuorescence staining and scoring
The immunoﬂuorescence-based RAD51 test was carried out
on FFPE patient tumor samples as described in Castroviejo-
Bermejo et al. and Cruz et al.16,17
The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-
RAD51 (Abcam ab133534, 1 : 1000), mouse anti-geminin
(NovoCastra NCL-L, 1 : 100 in patient-derived xenograft
samples, 1 : 60 in patient samples), rabbit anti-geminin
(ProteinTech 10802-1-AP, 1 : 400), mouse anti-BRCA1
(Abcam ab16780, 1 : 200), mouse anti-phospho-H2AX
(Millipore #05-636, 1 : 200). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa ﬂuor
568 (Invitrogen; 1 : 500), goat anti-mouse Alexa ﬂuor 488
(Invitrogen; 1 : 500), donkey anti-mouse Alexa ﬂuor 568
(Invitrogen; 1 : 500) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa ﬂuor 488
(Invitrogen; 1 : 500) were used as secondary antibodies.16
Biomarker scoring was carried out on to life images using
a 60-immersion oil lens.16,18 One hundred geminin-positive
cells from at least three representative areas of each sample
were analyzed and biomarker scores were calculated as the
percentage of geminin-positive cells with ﬁve or more nu-
clear foci of any size. Twenty-ﬁve (13%) samples with low
gH2AX (<25% of geminin-positive cells with gH2AX foci) and
34 (18%) samples with <40 geminin-positive cells were not
included in the analyses, due to insufﬁcient endogenous
DNA damage or tumor cells in the S/G2 phase of the
cell cycle and poor quality of the samples, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S1, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091). Tumors showing >10% of
geminin-positive cells with BRCA1 foci were considered
BRCA1 proﬁcient; tumors showing >10% of geminin-positive
cells with RAD51 foci were considered HRP.16,17
BRCA1/2 status deﬁnition
For 144 out of the 187 patients included in this study, the
BRCA1/2 mutational status was available, with 43 patients
being germline or somatically mutated and 96 wild
type (wt) as recorded from case report forms or determined
by targeted hybrid capture sequencing, as previously
described.10
HRD based on shallow WGS DNA libraries
Shallow WGS DNA libraries for Illumina sequencing were
prepared using the Watchmaker DNA Library Prep Kit
(Watchmaker Genomics, Boulder, CO), using 100 ng of DNA,
following the same procedure already published.11 The
paired-end sequencing reaction was carried out on the
Illumina NextSeq550 Dx System (Illumina, San Diego, CA),
loading the pool with a concentration of 1.5 pM and 2%
Phix 1.5 pM. Through the bioinformatic analysis, six inde-
pendent models spanning the 5- to 1000-kb genome win-
dow, implemented using the large-scale genomic alteration
(LGA) method19 and a neural network module,20 provided
the predicted HRD status, as previously described.10 Based
on the LGAs of myChoice CDx assay by Myriad Genetics
carried out on the ﬁrst 100 samples,10 we identiﬁed
the following groups of patients: HRD deﬁcient (LGA > 20),
HRD mild (15 < LGA < 19) and HRD negative (LGA < 14)
corresponding to a genomic score >50, 42-50 and <42,
respectively, as referred to the Myriad scoring.19
miR-506 expression
miRNA expression proﬁling was carried out on 100 ng of
total RNA using Agilent SurePrint G3 8  60K microarrays
designed on miRBase 21.0 and covering the expression of
2549 miRNAs, essentially following Agilent’s protocols
(see Bagnoli et al.21 for details). Relative expression of miR-
506 was considered after data normalization and ﬁltering.
Statistical methods
Data were described using median and interquartile range
for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages
for qualitative variables. The characteristics of the studied
population were compared with those of the population
enrolled in the MITO16A trial (Supplementary Table S1,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104
091). To evaluate the concordance between the genomic
test and functional HRD by RAD51 assay, Cohen’s k statistic
with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) was used. The k statistic
was interpreted as <0, indicating no agreement, 0.00-0.20
as slight, 0.21-0.40 as fair, 0.41-0.60 as moderate, 0.61-0.80
as substantial and 0.81-1.00 as an almost perfect agree-
ment. The prognostic value for the genomic test, the
functional HRD by RAD51 and miR-506 expression assay
was investigated in terms of PFS and overall survival (OS).
PFS was deﬁned as the time from registration to docu-
mented progression according to RECIST criteria, death due
to any cause or last follow-up date. OS was deﬁned as
the time from randomization to death due to any cause or
last information on the vital status. Survival curves were
calculated using the KaplaneMeier method and compared
by a log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using
the Cox regression model. In the multivariable models, the
following covariates were added: age (as category <65
versus 65 years), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (PS; 0 versus 1-2), residual disease
(none; 1 cm; >1 cm/not operated) and International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (III versus
IV). All the analyses were carried out with STATA 14 MP
(StataCorp 2015, Stata Statistical Software: Release 14,
StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Out of the 187 samples examined, 181 (97%) and 125 (67%)
were evaluable for genomic testing and RAD51 assay,
respectively
(Supplementary

ysis of concordance was conducted on 121 samples for
which both evaluations were available (Supplementary

causes of the failure rate for the RAD51 test: 34 out of 184

cells and were considered low-proliferation samples; 25

out of 184 samples (13%) exhibited insufﬁcient DNA dam-
age for evaluation in the functional HRD test. The charac-
teristics of the 183 analyzed patients closely mirrored those
of the participants in the MITO16A study (Supplementary
Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.
2024.104091). miRNA expression proﬁles were available
for 140 of 187 samples (Supplementary Figure S1A, avail-
able at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091).
Functional HRD by RAD51 assay
In the assessment of functional HRD using the RAD51 assay,
gH2AX emerged as the primary sensor of the HRR pathway.
The presence of gH2AX foci indicated double-strand breaks,
serving as the internal positive control for the RAD51 assay.
In the 125 (69%) evaluable samples (Supplementary
Figure S1A, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.
2024.104091), gH2AX showed a median expression of
53% (Figure 1A): these ﬁndings suggested that the majority
of HGSOC cases displayed high levels of endogenous DNA
damage (Supplementary Figure S1B, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091, and Figure 1A). The
functionality of the BRCA1 protein, a key mediator in the
HRR pathway, was assessed by immunoﬂuorescence. Sixty-
one (49%) of the samples exhibited negative BRCA1
immunoﬂuorescence (Figure 1B), indicating a loss of func-
tion in BRCA1 due to somatic or germline mutations or
epigenetic modiﬁcations. RAD51, the key effector of the
HRR pathway, was evaluated by immunoﬂuorescence to
determine HRD status, revealing that 91 (73%) tumors were
HRD in our cohort (Figure 1C). Fifty-seven out of 61 (93%)
BRCA1-negative tumors were HRD by RAD51; on the con-
trary, the main cause of HRD in this series was the loss of
function of BRCA1 which occurred in 57 out of 91 (63%)
HRD tumors.
Functional HRD by RAD51 did not predict response to
platinum salts in univariate analyses for PFS (Figure 2A) (HR
0.79, 95% CI 0.51-1.23, P ¼ 0.302) or OS (Figure 2B) (HR
0.76, 95% CI 0.42-1.39, P ¼ 0.378). The association with PFS
slightly improved in multivariate analyses when adjusted for
PS, age, stage and residual disease (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41-
1.03, P ¼ 0.07).
Evaluation of HRD by academic genomic testing
Analysis by academic genomic testing identiﬁed 69 out
of 121 tumors (57%) as HRD (Supplementary Table S2A,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104
091). HRD genomic testing was predictive of response to
platinum salts in terms of PFS in both univariate (HR 0.56,
95% CI 0.40-0.78, P ¼ 0.001) (Figure 2C) and multivariate
analyses (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.37-0.74, P < 0.001). No dif-
ferences were observed in terms of OS (HR 0.70, 95% CI
0.44-1.13, P ¼ 0.147) (Figure 2D).
No correlation was found between HRD status by RAD51
and HRD genomic test (Pearson r ¼ 0.17, P ¼ 0.06). RAD51
identiﬁed up to 33 HGSOC as HRD, which were negative
HRD
(neg-HRD)
for
genomic
testing
(Supplementary
Table S2A, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.
2024.104091) (Cohen’s k coefﬁcient ¼ 0.19, 95% CI 0.02-
0.36). To investigate the discrepancy, Ki67 expression
was examined in discordant cases, revealing positive per-
centages >10%, suggesting suitability for immunohisto-
chemistry/immunoﬂuorescence assays. Additionally, the
expression of gH2AX, as a positive internal control, was
rechecked in tumors with a RAD51 score <1, all presenting
an adequate percentage of endogenous DNA damage, with
a median of 50% (data not shown).
Group re-classiﬁcation by academic testing
A three-group genomic classiﬁcation based on HRD genomic
testing identiﬁed high-HRD, mild-HRD and neg-HRD tumors
(Materials

and Capoluongo et al.10). High-HRD, mild-HRD and neg-
HRD tumors constituted 43% (77/181), 14% (25/181) and
44% (79/181) of samples, respectively (Supplementary

strated statistically superior PFS in univariate (high versus

HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.34-1.59, P ¼ 0.433).
Among high-HRD tumors, there was a high concordance
with the RAD51 test, with 86% of tumors being HRD
for both tests (Supplementary Table S2B, available at

HRD’ tumors demonstrated statistically superior PFS compared

Combined genomic and functional HRD test

played statistically superior PFS compared with HRP tumors

miR-506 and HRD status in OvC samples of MITO16 trial
miR-506 exerts a regulatory role on genes related to DNA
repair recapitulating a BRCAness phenotype when highly
expressed in tumors. In a preliminary analysis on 72 of 100
samples used to set up the academic genomic assay,10 we
observed a signiﬁcant relative higher expression (as assessed
by microarray proﬁling) of miR-506 in the group of patients

expression was evaluable for 140 samples (Supplementary
Figure S1A, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.
2024.104091). In this further analysis, we took into consider-
ation that miR-506, due to its regulatory functions, is a tumor-
suppressive miRNA and it is therefore downregulated in
various cancers, with its high expression being a clinically
favorable prognostic factor.12,22 The upper quartile of miR-506

indeed associated with 68% and 76% of HRD samples by the
genomic testing and the functional assay, respectively
(Supplementary Table S3, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091). Since from a biological point
of view, what makes the difference is a high expression of miR-
506, we correlated the genomic (Supplementary Figure S2C,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091)
and functional (Supplementary Figure S2D, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091) HRD status
onlyconsidering the samples witha relative expressionof miR-
506 above the median value. Although the sample size did not
allow reaching a statistically signiﬁcant difference between
HRP and HRD samples, a clear trend in higher expression of
miR-506 in samples deﬁned HRD, particularly by RAD51 assay,
was evident (Supplementary Figure S2D, available at https://

(Supplementary Figure S3A, available at https://doi.org/10.

HRD methods resembled the results of the overall population:

were HRD andHRP forRAD51assay, respectively;23(68%)and

available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.104091,
illustrates the peculiar case of the patient with the highest
expression of miR-506: she was classiﬁed as neg-HRD for
genomic testing but HRD for the functional assay, supporting
once again the importance of combining genomic and func-
tional assays in order to increase the number of HRD patients
who might beneﬁt from PARPi.
DISCUSSION
OvC poses a challenge in clinical management due to its
late-stage
diagnosis
and
the
emergence
of
chemo-
resistance, particularly in HGSOC. The conventional treat-
ment
involving
carboplatin
and
paclitaxel
has
been
augmented with maintenance strategies, including PARPi,
especially for BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOC. However, the
inherent heterogeneity in treatment responses prompts a
deeper exploration of biomarkers beyond BRCA1/2 muta-
tions
for
expanding/reﬁning
the
patient
population
beneﬁting from PARPi and platinum salts.9
Numerous studies have investigated biomarkers of HRD
beyond BRCA1/2 mutations. Next-generation sequencing
panels, while dynamic, are constrained by current knowl-
edge and may exclude genes not yet known to be part of
HRR. Genomic HRD tests, or genomic scars, are static and
unable to identify tumors regaining HRR ability under

treatment pressure. The RAD51 assay, however, is both
functional and dynamic, capturing the actual HRR status of
tumors and identifying those that may have regained HRR
ability during the natural history of the disease.16,17,23
Trials like PRIMA and PAOLA demonstrated the associa-
tion between genomic HRD status and PARPi response in
HGSOC.4,6 While the PAOLA trial indicated that only tumors
classiﬁed as HRD by myChoice CDx assay beneﬁted from
olaparib, in the PRIMA trial, it was found that HRP tumors
still exhibited beneﬁts from treatment with niraparib. This
discrepancy may arise from several factors, including the
sensitivity and false-negative rate of the tests used to
determine HRD status. Furthermore, niraparib is known to
be more potent in trapping PARP1, which may enhance its
efﬁcacy even in ‘weaker’ HRD tumors.
Academic laboratories have been pivotal in developing
novel HRD testing approaches, trying to increase the plethora
of patients who may beneﬁt from PARPi. Previous work by
our group compared two academic genomic HRD tests and
RAD51 assay with Myriad as a reference standard, showing a
high level of concordance between genomic HRD tests and
Myriad.10 In this study, a larger cohort from the MITO16a trial
was analyzed, revealing complementary insights from
genomic testing and RAD51 assay. Despite technical chal-
lenges, the RAD51 assay identiﬁed heightened endogenous
DNA damage in 70% of HGSOC cases. However, functional
HRD by RAD51 did not predict response to platinum salts in
terms of PFS or OS. This discrepancy with other studies may
be attributed to technical challenges which led to a higher
failure rate in surgical samples, reducing the sample size of
our research.24-26 Despite its potential, the RAD51 assay
faced a 30% failure rate in this study, possibly linked to the
distinct quality of parafﬁn-embedded ovarian surgical sam-
ples compared with breast biopsies.27 Furthermore, the
follow-up data of the present study are inﬂuenced by the
addition of BEV to front-line treatment.14 Genomic HRD
testing classiﬁed 57% of tumors as HRD, aligning with existing
literature.4,6 A notable discordance emerged between HRD
status identiﬁed by RAD51 and genomic testing, emphasizing
the need for further investigation. The introduction of a
three-group genomic classiﬁcation based on HRD genomic
testing revealed superior PFS not only in high- but also in
mild-HRD tumors compared with neg-HRD tumors. Among
high-HRD tumors, a high concordance with the RAD51 test
was noted and ‘super-HRD’ tumors showed superior PFS
compared with ‘super-HRP’6 tumors. Considering both
genomic and functional HRD tests, 84% of OvC samples were
HRD for at least one test, demonstrating superior PFS
compared with tumors that were neg-HRD and HRP. This
study underscores the complexity of HRD assessment
and suggests that a combined genomic and functional
approach may enhance predictive accuracy for OvC treat-
ment responses.
The
clinical
signiﬁcance
of
HRD
testing
is
further
highlighted by recent approvals of PARPi as ﬁrst- and second-
line maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive HGSOC.28-31
Recently, the European Medicines Agency approved ola-
parib in combination with BEV (an anti-vascular endothelial
growth factor monoclonal antibody) as ﬁrst-line therapy in
HRD-positive platinum-sensitive HGSOC patients, using an
HRD diagnostic test with demonstrated clinical validity, the
myChoice CDx assay by Myriad Genetics.2,6,8,28,32 As the
most widely used test, Myriad has limitations, including
unknown status, false negatives and high cost.33,34 Newer
approaches, combining genomic testing and functional
activity, are crucial to optimizing the management of PARPi-
eligible patients. In this context, the combined score could
be helpful to: (i) refrain from using platinum-based chemo-
therapy sensitivity as a selection biomarker for PARPi,
thereby minimizing toxicities for patients who may not
derive beneﬁts from such treatments; (ii) utilize the RAD51
assay as a pre-screening tool to identify patients with
germline BRCA1/2 mutations, considering the low incidence
of these mutations in this speciﬁc subset of patients;
(iii) expand the pool of patients who could beneﬁt from
PARPi beyond those with platinum sensitivity or genomic
alterations.
Considering the complexity of HRR pathways, we should
take into consideration also the possible epigenetic regu-
lation of this process possibly mediated by miRNAs. miR-
506 is the most well-known miRNA in the ChrXq27.3
miRNA cluster, which has been linked to better prognosis in
HGSOC patients.35 Alongside miR-506, miR-508 and miR-
509, also found in this cluster, are known to have tumor-
suppressive roles.22 miR-506 responds to genotoxic stress,
suggesting its involvement in the DNA damage response.36
Similar expression patterns are observed for miR-508 and
miR-509, hinting at their potential roles in DNA damage
response as well, with miR-509 being a further regulator of
RAD51.37 Given their highly correlated expression,21,35 it is
likely that these miRNAs share target genes or regulate
similar signaling pathways. Our data suggested a possible
role of miR-506 expression as a reﬁnement of HRD status;
however, we need to rely on a more sensitive detection
method such as digital PCR, enabling detection of rare
transcripts (and miRNAs) and small quantitative variations,
and to expand the analysis on other miRNAs regulating the
same pathways, such as miR-509.
Looking ahead, the study suggests a roadmap for future
research: (i) standardizing HRD assessment methodologies
should be prioritized to facilitate cross-study comparisons;
(ii) combining genomic and functional HRD testing can help
identify patients with ‘weak HRD’ who may beneﬁt from
PARPis, as suggested by the ﬁndings from the PRIMA study;
we believe that this approach may provide a deeper un-
derstanding of patient selection for targeted therapies and
represents the novelty of our work; (iii) the signiﬁcant
discrepancy noted between the RAD51 test and genomic
HRD testing highlights the need for improved tumor clas-
siﬁcation based on HRD status, which we address in our
study; (iv) discrepancies among different assays can be due
to some pre-analytical issues38 related to the cellularity and
quality of the sample that can impair the HRD assessment,
at both functional and genomic levels.
The present paper conﬁrms the need of a better stan-
dardization and harmonization in HRD assessment, particularly

to overcome the pre-analytical limitations through the inte-
gration of multiple tests, including both genomic and func-
tional assays, as we have reported in this article. Ongoing
analyses on samples from patients enrolled in the MITO35
trial (EudraCT number: 2021-000244-21) will be crucial to
conﬁrm the predictive role of the combined score and of
miRNA regulation to PARPi response.
In conclusion, this study provides a valuable contribution
to the ongoing discourse on HRD assessment in OvC. By
highlighting the complexities and nuances of genomic and
functional testing, the research prompts a reevaluation of
current approaches and underscores the need for a more
personalized and dynamic understanding of HRD for
improved patient outcomes.
