abstract
PURPOSE To provide recommendations on the use of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) for
management of epithelial ovarian, tubal, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC).
METHODS Randomized, controlled, and open-labeled trials published from 2011 through 2020 were identiﬁed in
a literature search. Guideline recommendations were based on the review of the evidence, US Food and Drug
Administration approvals, and consensus when evidence was lacking.
RESULTS The systematic review identiﬁed 17 eligible trials.
RECOMMENDATIONS The guideline pertains to patients who are PARPi na¨ıve. All patients with newly diagnosed,
stage III-IV EOC whose disease is in complete or partial response to ﬁrst-line, platinum-based chemotherapy with
high-grade serous or endometrioid EOC should be offered PARPi maintenance therapy with niraparib. For
patients with germline or somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 (g/sBRCA1) or BRCA2
(g/sBRCA2) genes should be treated with olaparib. The addition of olaparib to bevacizumab may be offered to
patients with stage III-IV EOC with g/sBRCA1/2 and/or genomic instability and a partial or complete response
to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab combination. Maintenance therapy (second line or more) with single-
agent PARPi may be offered for patients with EOC who have not received a PARPi and have responded to
platinum-based therapy regardless of BRCA mutation status. Treatment with a PARPi should be offered to
patients with recurrent EOC that has not recurred within 6 months of platinum-based therapy, who have not
received a PARPi and have a g/sBRCA1/2, or whose tumor demonstrates genomic instability. PARPis are not
recommended for use in combination with chemotherapy, other targeted agents, or immune-oncology agents
in the recurrent setting outside the context of a clinical trial. Recommendations for managing speciﬁc adverse
events are presented. Data to support reuse of PARPis in any setting are needed.

INTRODUCTION
In 2020, it is estimated that there will be 21,750 new
cases of ovarian cancers diagnosed in the United
States, and despite advances in treatment, an esti-
mated 13,940 women will die of the disease.1 A
woman’s risk of getting ovarian cancer during her
lifetime is approximately 1 in 78 and her lifetime
chance of dying of ovarian cancer is about 1 in 108.1
Approximately 85%-90% of all ovarian cancers are
epithelial in origin, and approximately 70% of all ep-
ithelial ovarian cancers are high-grade serous (HGS)
adenocarcinoma.2 Despite initial therapy, usually
consisting of surgical cytoreduction and platinum-
taxane combination therapy, the majority of women
with advanced-stage epithelial ovarian, tubal, or pri-
mary peritoneal cancer (hereinafter referred to as
EOC), will have a relapse of their disease and require
additional treatment.3
Germline alterations in breast cancer 1 (gBRCA1) and
breast cancer 2 (gBRCA2) genes have been identiﬁed
in up to 17% of women diagnosed with EOC, and
somatic mutations are found in an additional 7%.4-7
Approximately 41%-50% of EOCs are estimated to
exhibit homologous recombination deﬁciency (HRD)
involved in repair of DNA damage and replication.8

Guideline Questions
1. Should PARPi therapy for EOC be repeated over the course of treatment?
2. In which patients with newly diagnosed EOC are PARPis recommended?
a. What are the histologic types of EOC for which PARPis are recommended?
b. What are the biomarker subsets for which PARPis are recommended?
3. Is PARPi monotherapy recommended for recurrent EOC? If so,
a. In which settings (eg, second-line maintenance or treatment of recurrent disease)?
b. At what dose and duration?
4. Are there settings where PARPis in combination with chemotherapy or other targeted therapy are recommended?
5. How should clinicians manage the speciﬁc toxicities of the various PARPis?
Target Population
Patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian, tubal, or primary peritoneal cancer (EOC) who have not previously received
a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi).
Target Audience
Medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists; gynecologic oncologists; gynecologists; advanced practice and other health
professionals; women with ovarian cancer and their families.
METHODS
An Expert Panel was convened to develop clinical practice guideline recommendations on the basis of a systematic review of
the medical literature and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory approvals.
Recommendations
Note: These recommendations pertain only to patients with EOC who have not previously received a PARPi. The recommendations
are based on clinical trial results and FDA approvals and do not necessarily capture regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions.
Repeating PARPi
Recommendation 1.0.
Repeating PARPi therapy in the treatment of EOC is not recommended at this time. Consideration
should be made as to the best time in the life cycle of an individual patient’s EOC in which to use PARPi; clinical trial
participation is encouraged (Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of
recommendation: strong).
Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer
Recommendation 2.0. PARPis are not recommended for use in initial treatment of early stage (stage I-II) EOC because there is
insufﬁcient evidence to support use in this population (Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality:
insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 2.1.
Women with newly diagnosed stage III-IV EOC that is in complete or partial response to ﬁrst-line
platinum-based chemotherapy should be offered PARPi maintenance therapy with olaparib (for those with germline or
somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes) or niraparib (all women) in high-grade serous
(HGS) or endometrioid ovarian cancer.
• PARPi maintenance therapy should consist of olaparib (300 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 years) or niraparib (200-
300 mg orally daily for 3 years). Longer duration could be considered in selected individuals. (Type: evidence based,
beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 2.2. The addition of olaparib to bevacizumab maintenance may be offered to patients who have stage III-IV
HGS or endometrioid ovarian cancer and germline or somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2
genes and/or genomic instability, as determined by Myriad myChoice CDx, and who have had a partial or complete response to
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab combination (Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: strong;
Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 2.3.
Inclusion of the PARPi veliparib with combination chemotherapy followed by veliparib maintenance
therapy cannot be recommended at this time. There are no data that this approach is superior, equal, or less toxic than
a switch maintenance (Type: evidence based; beneﬁt/harms ratio unknown; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of
recommendation: strong).

THE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
Note: As of this writing, veliparib is not commercially available.
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer: Second-Line or Greater Maintenance and Treatment
Recommendation 3.0. PARPi monotherapy maintenance (second-line or more) may be offered to patients with EOC who have
not already received a PARPi and who have responded to platinum-based therapy regardless of BRCA mutation status;
treatment is continued until progression of disease or toxicity despite dose reductions and best supportive care.
• Options include: olaparib 300 mg every 12 hours; rucaparib 600 mg every 12 hours; niraparib 200-300 mg once daily.
(Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 3.1. Treatment with a PARPi should be offered to patients with recurrent EOC who have not already received
a PARPi and have a germline or somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
• Options include: olaparib 300 mg every 12 hours; rucaparib 600 mg every 12 hours; niraparib 200-300 mg once daily
(Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 3.2. Treatment with a PARPi monotherapy should be offered to patients with recurrent EOC who have not
already received a PARPi and whose tumor demonstrates genomic instability, as determined by Myriad myChoice CDx, and
has not recurred within 6 months of platinum-based therapy (Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence
quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 3.3.
PARPis are not recommended for treatment of BRCA wild-type or platinum-resistant recurrent EOC
(Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
PARPis in Combination
Recommendation 4.0.
PARPi are not recommended for use in combination with chemotherapy, other targeted agents, or
immune-oncology agents in the recurrent setting outside the context of a clinical trial. Clinical trial participation is encouraged
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Management of Adverse Events
Recommendation 5.0 Anemia:
a. Patients requiring a blood transfusion for symptom relief and/or hemoglobin level , 8 g/dL should be monitored. PARPi
dose should be reduced with evidence of repeated anemia to avoid multiple transfusions.
b. Patients with progressive anemia may be offered growth factor per ASCO guidelines and physician and patient comfort.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 5.1 Neutropenia:
a. Growth factor is not indicated for use in patients receiving daily PARPi.
b. Neutropenia (grade 4 lasting at least 5-7 days or associated with fever) should result in dose hold until recovery of
infection and granulocyte count, followed by dose reduction. Growth factor support may be used in this setting to
support patient safety during the drug hold.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 5.2 Platelets:
a. Thrombocytopenia is most common with niraparib. Niraparib dosing guidelines should be used to lower starting dose
(200 mg) based on weight and platelet count.
b. Discontinue PARPi for persistent thrombocytopenia or signiﬁcant bleeding despite dose reduction.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate)
Recommendation 5.3 Persistent cytopenia:
a. Evaluation for treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia should be initiated in patients with
persistent cytopenia that occurs despite drug hold.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Recommendation 5.4 Nausea:
a. Many patients will have tachyphylaxis of nausea symptoms over the ﬁrst cycle of therapy.
b. Persistent nausea requiring daily antiemetic intervention, causing a reduction in performance status, and/or resulting in
. 5% weight loss should result in dose reduction.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: moderate).

inhibitors (PARPis) has led to major change in the ap-
proaches to EOC management across the treatment life
cycle. In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved the ﬁrst PARPi, olaparib, as a treatment
of gBRCA EOC for patients who had received $ 3 prior
lines of chemotherapy. Rucaparib received FDA approval
for treatment of g/sBRCA recurrent disease in 2016.
Approval for niraparib and, subsequently, olaparib as
maintenance therapy for women with complete or partial
response to platinum-based chemotherapy was granted
in 2017. Since then, the FDA has expanded the regulatory
approval of PARPis, thereby allowing more patients to
beneﬁt from these agents and access the drugs earlier in
treatment. Recent studies have conﬁrmed that the efﬁ-
cacy of PARPis is enhanced not only in g/sBRCA EOC but
also in cancers in which HRD is caused by other un-
derlying etiologies. The applications of PARPis in the
management of EOC are complex and all approvals to
date are predicated on the absence of prior exposure to
PARPis.
The purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians,
other health care practitioners, patients, and caregivers
with recommendations regarding the role of PARPis in
the management of EOC based on the best available
evidence.
GUIDELINE QUESTIONS
This clinical practice guideline addresses ﬁve overarching
clinical questions:
1. Should PARPi therapy for EOC be repeated over the
course of treatment?
2. In which patients with newly diagnosed EOC are
PARPis recommended?
2a. What are the histologic types of EOC for which
PARPis are recommended?
2b. What are the biomarker subsets for which PARPis
are recommended?
3. Is PARPi monotherapy recommended for recurrent
EOC? If so:
3a. In which settings (eg, second-line maintenance or
treatment of recurrent disease)?
3b. At what dose and duration?
4. Are there settings where PARPis in combination
with chemotherapy or other targeted therapy are
recommended?
5. How should clinicians manage the speciﬁc toxicities of
the various PARPis?
METHODS
Guideline Development Process
This systematic review-based guideline was developed by
a multidisciplinary Expert Panel, which included two patient
representatives and an ASCO guidelines staff member with
health research methodology expertise (Appendix Table
A1, online only). The Expert Panel met in person, via
teleconference, and/or webinar, and corresponded through
e-mail. Based on the consideration of the evidence and
FDA regulatory approval, the authors were asked to con-
tribute to the development of the guideline, provide critical
review, and ﬁnalize the guideline recommendations. The
guideline recommendations were sent for an open com-
ment period of 2 weeks, allowing the public to review and
comment on the recommendations after submitting
a conﬁdentiality agreement. These comments were taken
into consideration while ﬁnalizing the recommendations.
Members of the Expert Panel were responsible for reviewing
and approving the penultimate version of the guideline,
which was then circulated for external review, and sub-
mitted to Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO) for editorial
review and consideration for publication. All ASCO guide-
lines are ultimately reviewed and approved by the Expert
Panel and the ASCO Clinical Practice Guidelines Com-
mittee before publication. All funding for the administration
of the project was provided by ASCO.
The recommendations were developed by using a sys-
tematic review of the literature conducted in PubMed for
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from Jan-
uary 1, 2009, to May 3, 2019. The search was then
updated on April 20, 2020, and relevant trials released at
ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) 2019 and
ASCO 2020 were also identiﬁed. The FDA’s Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research database was also searched for
regulatory information. Articles were selected for inclusion
in the systematic review of the evidence on the basis of the
following criteria:
THE BOTTOM LINE (CONTINUED)
ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients
should have the opportunity to participate.

• Population: Adult women with EOC
• Intervention: PARPi, including olaparib, niraparib,
rucaparib, and veliparib
• Comparator: Standard-of-care options or placebo
• Outcomes: Therapeutic efﬁcacy (eg, survival, re-
sponse rate), health-related quality of life, adverse
events
• Fully published or recent meeting presentations of
English-language reports of phase II-III RCTs
• For special circumstances, prospective, single-arm
trials were accepted.
Articles were excluded from the systematic review if they
were (1) editorials, commentaries, letters, news articles,
case reports, narrative reviews; or (2) published in a non-
English language. The guideline recommendations were
crafted, in part, using the Guidelines Into Decision Support
(GLIDES) methodology and accompanying BRIDGE-Wiz
software.9 In addition, a guideline implementability re-
view was conducted. Based on the implementability review,
revisions were made to the draft to clarify recommended
actions for clinical practice. Ratings for the type and
strength of recommendation, evidence, and potential bias
are provided with each recommendation.
The ASCO Expert Panel and guidelines staff will work with
co-chairs to keep abreast of any substantive updates to
the guideline. Based on formal review of the emerging
literature, ASCO will determine the need to update. The
ASCO Guidelines Methodology Manual (hereafter, Meth-
odology Manual; available at www.asco.org/guidelines-
methodology) provides additional information about the
guideline update process. This is the most recent in-
formation as of the publication date.

Guideline and Conﬂicts of Interest
The Expert Panel was assembled in accordance with
ASCO’s Conﬂict of Interest Policy Implementation for
Clinical Practice Guidelines (“Policy,” found at www.asco.org/
rwc). All members of the Expert Panel completed ASCO’s
disclosure form, which requires disclosure of ﬁnancial and
other interests, including relationships with commercial
entities that are reasonably likely to experience direct
regulatory or commercial impact as a result of pro-
mulgation of the guideline. Categories for disclosure in-
clude employment; leadership; stock or other ownership;
honoraria, consulting or advisory role; speaker’s bureau;
research funding; patents, royalties, other intellectual
property; expert testimony; travel, accommodations, ex-
penses; and other relationships. In accordance with the
Policy, the majority of the members of the Expert Panel did
not disclose any relationships constituting a conﬂict under
the Policy.
RESULTS
A total of 17 trials10-27 met eligibility criteria and form the
evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations
(Table 1). Outcomes are summarized in Tables 2-5. The
identiﬁed trials were published between 2011 and 2020
and compared, when comparators were part of the study
design, PARPis to standard-of-care options or placebo. The
primary outcome for all trials was therapeutic efﬁcacy,
expressed as progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary
and exploratory outcomes included overall survival (OS),
objective response rate, progression-free survival 2, time to
discontinuation of treatment or death, time to ﬁrst sub-
sequent therapy or death (TFST), adverse events (AEs) and
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Characteristics of the
studies’ participants are outlined in Table 1. Figure 1
outlines the current approval of PARPis in ovarian cancer.
Study Quality
Study design aspects related to individual study quality,
strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and
risk of bias were assessed. Refer to the Methodology

Manual for more information and for deﬁnitions of ratings
for overall potential risk of bias.
Study quality was formally assessed for the fully published
trials identiﬁed but not for the study only available in ab-
stract form.26 Design aspects related to the individual study
quality were assessed by one reviewer, including factors
such as blinding, allocation concealment, placebo control,
intention to treat (ITT), funding sources, and so forth, and
generally indicated a low to intermediate potential risk of
bias for most of the identiﬁed evidence. In general, the
quality of the included studies ranged from intermediate to
high. Quality assessment ratings are found in the Data
Supplement. Please refer to Methodology Manual for
deﬁnitions of ratings for overall potential risk of bias.
KEY OUTCOMES OF INTEREST
Efﬁcacy
Newly diagnosed (frontline) maintenance setting. In the
upfront setting, a total of four trials investigated PARPis for
maintenance therapy, two as monotherapy13,20 one as
combination therapy,24 and one as combination therapy
followed by monotherapy.10
The SOLO1 trial20 investigated olaparib as ﬁrst-line main-
tenance therapy in patients with gBRCA1/2 International
Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FIGO) stage III-
IV, HGS or endometrioid EOC after a complete response
(CR) or partial response (PR) to initial ﬁrst-line, platinum-
based chemotherapy. The trial showed that maintenance
with olaparib improved PFS compared with placebo
(hazard ratio [HR], 0.30; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.41). Although
the data from secondary outcomes are still immature, they
suggest olaparib delays TFST (median, 51.8 months)
compared with placebo (median, 15.1 months; TFST HR,
0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.40).
The PRIMA trial13 investigated the efﬁcacy of niraparib
maintenance therapy after a response to platinum-based
chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced
(FIGO stage III-IV), HGS or endometrioid EOC at high risk
for relapse. The trial conﬁrmed that the clinical beneﬁt of
ﬁrst-line treatment with niraparib could be extended to all
patients with advanced EOC regardless of HRD status,
which was used as a stratiﬁcation factor. In the overall
population, a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in median duration of PFS
was seen with niraparib over placebo (13.8 months v 8.2
months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.76; P , .001). PFS
was also signiﬁcantly improved in those with HRD tumors
(21.9 months v 10.4 months; HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.31 to
0.59; P , .001). The extended median duration of PFS was
also observed in the niraparib group compared with the
placebo group (8.1 months v 5.4 months; HR, 0.68) in the
subgroup of patients with homologous recombination–
proﬁcient tumors.
The PAOLA-124 trial is the ﬁrst phase III trial to examine the
efﬁcacy of a PARPi
with bevacizumab as
ﬁrst-line
maintenance therapy in patients with advanced (FIGO
stage III-IV), HGS and endometrioid EOC (other histologies
if gBRCAm) with CR or PR (CR/PR) to standard platinum-
based chemotherapy given with bevacizumab. Patients,
who were not restricted by surgical outcome or gBRCA
status, were randomly assigned to receive olaparib for up to
24 months and bevacizumab for 15 months in total, or
placebo. A statistically signiﬁcant improvement in PFS was
demonstrated in the ITT population compared with placebo
(median PFS, 22.1 months v 16.6 months; HR, 0.59;
95% CI, 0.49 to 0.72; P , .0001). Prespeciﬁed subgroup
analyses showed that patients with sBRCA mutations (HR,
0.31; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.47) and patients with positive HRD
status (including g/sBRCA-mutated tumors; HR, 0.33;
95% CI, 0.25 to 0.45) had the greatest PFS beneﬁts. No
beneﬁt was observed in patients with negative HRD status
(16.6 v 16.2 months; HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.35). The
recent approval was limited to women with g/sBRCA and
and/or genomic instability by Myriad myChoice CDx
(Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake City, UT) and who have had
a CR/PR to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab combination.
The VELIA trial10 assessed the efﬁcacy of veliparib added to
ﬁrst-line chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel and
continued as maintenance monotherapy in patients with
previously untreated, advanced, FIGO stage III-IV, HGS
EOC. In the overall population, the median PFS was
23.5 months in the induction and maintenance veliparib
group compared with 17.3 months in those receiving
placebo (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.83; P , .001). In
patients with gBRCA mutation, the median PFS was 34.7
versus 22.0 months, respectively, in the veliparib com-
pared with the control group (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28 to
0.68; P , .001). In the HRD cohort, the corresponding
duration was 31.9 months and 20.5 months, respectively
(HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.76; P , .001). In the ITT
population, median PFS was 23.5 months versus 17.3
months, respectively (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.83; P ,
.001). Stratiﬁcation was based on gBRCA status and was
added 14 months after initiation of the study, at which time
the study was more than half accrued. No beneﬁt was seen
in patients with homologous-recombination–deﬁcient
BRCA wild-type (BRCAwt) disease (HR, 0.74; 95% CI,
0.52 to 1.06) or those with homologous-recombination–
proﬁcient disease (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.09).
Veliparib is not approved in this setting and is not com-
mercially available at this writing.
Treatment of Recurrence Setting. Eight studies12,14,16,18,21,22,25,26
were identiﬁed that investigated PARPis as treatment for re-
currence. Four open-label, phase II studies12,14,18,26 examined
olaparib for patients with gBRCAm advanced EOC. Each study
found improved clinical beneﬁt with olaparib. Two single-arm
studies of rucaparib, ARIEL 225 and Study 10,16, also both
demonstrated improved PFS in measurable gBRCAm ovarian
cancer.

aIn an attempt to improve dosing constraints of the capsule formulation, an alternative tablet formulation with improved bioavailability was developed to facilitate olaparib administration to patients.
Comparisons of the bioavailability of these two different oral formulations was investigated.29 Study 24 demonstrated that patients’ exposure after tablet doses $ 300 mg BID matched or exceeded that of the
approved 400-mg BID capsule formulation (8 3 5-mg capsules BID). The 300-mg tablet dose BID was better tolerated than higher doses and it showed similar effectiveness in tumor shrinkage.

The SOLO3 trial22 assessed the efﬁcacy of olaparib com-
pared with chemotherapy of physician’s choice in patients
with platinum-sensitive, relapsed, HGS or endometrioid
EOC with gBRCAm. Patients were stratiﬁed by type of
chemotherapy received, prior lines of chemotherapy (2-
3 v $ 4), and platinum-free interval (6-12 v . 12 months).
The objective response rate (ORR) by independent central
review was 72% with olaparib versus 51% with treatment of
physician’s choice (odds ratio, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.58;
P 5 .002). The HR for PFS independent central review was
0.62 (95% CI, 0.43 to 0.91; P 5 .013), with a median of
13.4 months with olaparib versus 9.2 months with che-
motherapy. The PFS by investigator assessment was 0.49
(95% CI, 0.35 to 0.70; P , .001), with a median of 13.2
versus 8.5 months, respectively.
The QUADRA trial,21 a single-arm nonrandomized trial,
evaluated niraparib in adult patients with relapsed, HGS
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
cancer who had been treated with $ 3 previous che-
motherapy regimens. The trial met its primary end point of
overall response, with 13 of 47 patients (28%; 95% CI,
15.6% to 42.6%; one-sided P 5 .00053) with HRD-positive
tumors who received three to four previous anticancer
therapies and were sensitive to the most recent platinum-
based therapy. The median duration of PFS in this pop-
ulation was 5.5 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 8.2 months), and
median duration of response was 9.2 months (95% CI,
5.9–not estimable months). A total of 38 of 456 patients
(8%) in the modiﬁed per-protocol population achieved an
overall response. The observed median OS in the modiﬁed
per-protocol population was 17.2 months (95% CI, 14.9 to
19.8 months).
Second-line and beyond maintenance setting. Four trials
investigated the efﬁcacy of PARPis in maintenance therapy
in recurrent disease.11,17,19,23,28
Study 1917 accrued patients with platinum-sensitive, re-
current, high-grade EOC who had received $ 2 prior lines of
platinum-based chemotherapy and had a CR/PR to the
most recent treatment, demonstrating olaparib mainte-
nance signiﬁcantly improved PFS (median 8.4 v 4.8
months; HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.49; P , .001).

Retrospective testing for g/sBRCA mutations was per-
formed for all patients, and it was determined that 51% of
participants had g/sBRCAm. Patients with gBRCAm tumors
were reported to have a 6.9-month prolongation of median
PFS (11.2 compared with 4.3 months in the olaparib and
placebo arms, respectively). Additional analyses in the
BRCAwt population also demonstrated a statistically sig-
niﬁcant difference in favor of the olaparib maintenance
treatment arm. However, the magnitude of difference was
lower when compared with the population of patients with
gBRCAm (7.4 months v 5.5 months; HR, 0.54; 95% CI,
0.34 to 0.85; P 5 .0075). Analyses for OS28 showed
a slight survival advantage with olaparib over placebo in
the ITT population (media OS, 29.8 v 27.8 months, re-
spectively; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.95; P 5 .02) after
a median follow-up of 78 months. In the gBRCAm
population, OS was 34.9 months versus 30.2 months in
the olaparib-treated patients compared with those re-
ceiving placebo, respectively. The median improvement
in OS was 4.7 months longer for olaparib versus placebo
(HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.93). It is notable that
the threshold was not set to determine statistical signif-
icance for OS in the BRCAm subgroup; therefore, the
reported P values are nominal.
The SOLO2 trial23 investigated olaparib monotherapy in
patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, g/sBRCA1/2m
EOC who had received $ 2 lines of chemotherapy and
demonstrated a CR/PR to the most recent line of treatment.
Results showed a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in
the median PFS for olaparib over placebo of 13.6 months
(median PFS, 19.1 v 5.5 months), translating to a 70%
reduction in risk of disease progression or death with
olaparib versus placebo (HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.41;
P , .0001). The proportion of patients who had not ex-
perienced disease progression at 12 months was
3.1 times greater in the olaparib group than in the placebo
group (65.1% v 20.9%, respectively). Moreover, the
proportion of patients who remained progression free at the
2-year mark was 2.8 times greater in the olaparib group than
in the placebo group (43.0% v 15.1%, respectively). A
preplanned, ﬁnal, OS analysis with data maturity of
61% demonstrated that olaparib extended OS by approxi-
mately 13 months compared with placebo (38.8 v 51.7
months; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.00; P 5 .054) in the full
analysis set.27 In the prespeciﬁed sensitivity analysis of
patients with germline BRCA mutation, OS was extended by
15 months with olaparib compared with placebo (37.4 v
52.4 months; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97; P 5 .031).27

The NOVA trial19 evaluated niraparib in patients with
platinum-sensitive, recurrent EOC who had a CR/PR after
$ 2 prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy. Niraparib
maintenance signiﬁcantly improved PFS, compared with
placebo, irrespective of the gBRCAm (21.0 v 5.5 months;
HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.41; P , .001) or HRD status
(HRD plus BRCAwt: 12.9 v 3.8 months; HR, 0.38; 95% CI,
0.24 to 0.59; P , .001) and in the overall BRCAwt group
(9.3 v 3.9 months; HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.61;
P , .001).
The ARIEL 3 trial11 for rucaparib included three populations
for step-down analysis of the primary end point, PFS: tumor
BRCA-mutant (germline or somatic); HRD-positive, which
included the gBRCAm group along with those with a pos-
itive HRD score (including BRCAwt with high [$ 16%]
genomic loss of heterozygosity; and the ITT [all-comer]
population), which, again, included the gBRCAm and
HRD-positive groups.11 PFS was signiﬁcantly improved with
rucaparib versus placebo in all three populations, although
the most robust clinical outcomes were seen in the
gBRCAm subgroup.
Quality of Life
Seven RCTs10,13,17,19,20,23,24 reported quality-of-life (QOL)
end points with high completion rates. Analyses of these
patient-reported outcomes found, in general, the majority of
QOL scores numerically favored treatment with PARPis.
However, few signiﬁcant differences were observed be-
tween the treatment groups. In the absence of disease-
related symptoms for trials occurring in the maintenance
setting, that comparable scores were observed over time
across and between treatment groups suggests that women
maintain QOL during their PARPi treatment when com-
pared with placebo. PARPis did not appear to incur ad-
ditional burden or negatively impact HRQoL either during
treatment or long-term follow up.
Adverse Events
The proportion of patients who experienced any AEs was
higher in patients receiving PARPis than those in the
comparator groups (Table 5). Anemia was the most
common grade $ 3 AE in the PARPi group, reported to
range from 5% to 22% with olaparib,17,20,22,23 19% to
38% with rucaparib,11,16,25 25% to 31% with niraparib,13,19
38% to 41% with veliparib combination therapy,10 and
17% with olaparib plus bevacizumab.24 The incidence of
other AEs such as fatigue/asthenia, nausea, and vomiting
were much lower (Table 5). Hematologic toxicities were
more frequent with veliparib combination and niraparib
monotherapy than with treatment with other PARPis. Grade
3 or higher neutropenia occurred in up to 62% of patients
receiving veliparib combination treatment10 and in
19.6% of patient treated with niraparib.19 Similarly,
thrombocytopenia was reported in up to 31% of patients
receiving veliparib combination treatment and in 34% of
those treated with niraparib. However, in the NOVA trial,
thrombocytopenia was transient and treatment discontin-
uations were not attributed to these hematologic events.19
The most prominent grade 3/4 AEs with rucaparib included
fatigue (26.2%) and nausea and vomiting (14%).16 Overall,
management of AEs, for the majority of cases, were han-
dled with appropriate dose reductions and delays.
RECOMMENDATIONS
NOTE: These recommendations pertain only to patients
with EOC who have not previously received a PARPi. The
recommendations are based on clinical trial results and
FDA approvals and do not necessarily capture regulatory
approval in other jurisdictions.
CLINICAL QUESTION 1
Repeating PARPi
Should PARPi therapy for EOC be repeated over the course
of treatment?
Recommendation 1.0
Repeating PARPi therapy in the treatment of EOC is not
recommended at this time. Consideration should be made
as to the best time in the life cycle of an individual patient’s
EOC in which to use PARPi; clinical trial participation is
encouraged (Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh
harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recom-
mendation: strong).
Literature review and analysis.
Trials investigating the
redeployment of PARPis are currently underway. Enroll-
ment began in 2017 for the OReO/ENGOT Ov-38 trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT03106987), a random-
ized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of olaparib
maintenance retreatment in patients with nonmucinous
EOC, and a CR/PR to their most recent platinum-based
chemotherapy. Eligibility requires prior receipt of mainte-
nance PARPi therapy. Random assignment to olaparib or
matching placebo is split across two cohorts (approximately
416 patients): patients with a known BRCAm in cohort 1;
patients with BRCAwt in cohort 2. The primary end point is
investigator-assessed PFS and the study is expected to be
completed in 2021.
CLINICAL QUESTION 2
Newly Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer
For which patients with newly diagnosed EOC are PARPi
recommended?
a. What are the histologic types of EOC for which PARPis
are recommended?
b. What are the biomarker subsets for which PARPis are
recommended?
Recommendation 2.0
PARPis are not recommended for use in initial treatment of
early-stage (ie, stage I-II) EOC, because there is insufﬁcient
evidence to support use in this population. (Type: informal

consensus; beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality:
insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation: strong)
Recommendation 2.1
Women with newly diagnosed stage III-IV EOC whose
disease is in CR/PR to ﬁrst-line, platinum-based chemo-
therapy should be offered PARPi maintenance therapy with
olaparib (for those with germline or somatic pathogenic or
likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes) or
niraparib (all women) for treatment of high-grade serous
or endometrioid ovarian cancer.
• PARPi maintenance therapy should consist of olaparib
(300 mg orally every 12 hours for 2 years) or niraparib
(200-300 mg orally daily for 3 years). Longer duration
could be considered in selected individuals.
(Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence
quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 2.2
The addition of olaparib to bevacizumab maintenance may
be offered to patients who have stage III-IV, high-grade
serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer and germline or
somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in BRCA1
or BRCA2 genes and/or genomic instability, as determined
by Myriad myChoice CDx, and who have a CR/PR to
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab combination (Type: evi-
dence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality:
strong; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 2.3
Inclusion of the PARPi veliparib with combination che-
motherapy followed by veliparib maintenance therapy
cannot be recommended at this time. There are no data
that this approach is superior, equal, or less toxic than
a switch maintenance (Type: evidence based; beneﬁts/
harms ratio unknown; Evidence quality: intermediate;
Strength of recommendation: strong).
Note: As of this writing, veliparib is not commercially available.
Literature review and analysis.
The efﬁcacy of PARPi as
front-line maintenance therapy has been demonstrated in
four randomized trials identiﬁed by the systematic review:
SOLO1,20 PRIMA,13 PAOLA-1,24 and VELIA.10 Maintenance
therapy with PARPi achieved substantial PFS beneﬁt
among patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian
cancer after a CR/PR to the most recent regimen. SOLO120
demonstrated that, after a CR/PR to ﬁrst-line platinum-
based
chemotherapy,
olaparib
maintenance
therapy
confers PFS beneﬁts to patients with advanced primary
BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer (Table 2). The PRIMA
trial,13 in which patients newly diagnosed with advanced
ovarian cancer were enrolled regardless of their BRCA
status, found a signiﬁcant improvement in PFS compared
with placebo in the overall population (Table 2). The PFS
beneﬁt was even more pronounced in the HRD-positive
patient subgroup. Notably, maintenance with niraparib also
demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of disease
progression or death in the HRD-negative subgroup.
Two trials were identiﬁed that considered PARPi combi-
nation therapy. The PAOLA-1 trial24 investigated the efﬁ-
cacy of maintenance therapy with a PARPi in patients with
advanced ovarian cancer regardless of BRCA mutation
status who are receiving ﬁrst-line standard-of-care treat-
ment including bevacizumab. Results demonstrate ola-
parib added to bevacizumab maintenance treatment
signiﬁcantly improved PFS in the overall population. The
beneﬁt was even more pronounced in the BRCA-mutated
and HRD-positive subgroups. No statistically signiﬁcant
beneﬁt was seen in patients with HRD-negative tumors
(HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.35). VELIA10 evaluated
a PARPi, veliparib, in combination with chemotherapy
(carboplatin and paclitaxel), followed by PARPi mainte-
nance treatment in the ﬁrst-line setting. The primary
analysis demonstrated a signiﬁcantly extended PFS in all
women, regardless of biomarker status. However, it re-
mains unclear if the addition of veliparib is necessary for the
overall beneﬁt, because no chemotherapy-plus-placebo
comparator arm was included in the study design.
Clinical interpretation. All trials reported to date present
results for women who were PARPi na¨ıve at the time of
initiation of PARPi therapy. The rapid progression of studies
examining PARPi for therapy of recurrent disease to
second-line maintenance to front-line maintenance limited
having a re-exposure scenario. This is an important area of
unmet need for investigation. Retreatment off study is
strongly discouraged because it is unsupported by data and
prevents the capture of data that may be useful to the
community. The lack of OS beneﬁt from any of the treat-
ment or maintenance studies to date should be balanced
against factors such as the unknown short-term and late
risks (eg, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]/myelodysplastic
syndromes [MDS]) and development of collateral re-
sistance to other agents (eg, platinum).
Physicians and patients are strongly encouraged to con-
sider the full life cycle of advanced ovarian cancer against
current data in determining when to use PARPi for indi-
vidual care (Fig 1). The evolution of knowledge regarding
mechanisms of resistance to PARPi makes clear that pa-
rameters deﬁning resistance (eg, minimum treatment-free
interval, biomarker selection) may need to be taken into
account in clinical testing of PARPi retreatment. This
should be done in the context of well-deﬁned clinical trials.
The recommendations herein are focused on the use of
PARPi for women with ovarian cancer who have not re-
ceived prior treatment with a PARPi.
Data are strong from all studies indicating that women with
gBRCAm (or the rare sBRCAm) have improved PFS with
PARPi maintenance therapy with either olaparib or nir-
aparib. The recently published ASCO guideline on germline
and somatic tumor testing in epithelial ovarian cancer30

recommends early germline testing. This recommenda-
tion recognizes that the identiﬁcation of a deleterious
germline or somatic mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 would
inform
PARPi
treatment
decisions
for
women
with
newly diagnosed disease. The PRIMA study demonstrates
progression-free beneﬁt for all women with high-grade
serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer. Together, these
results support consideration of primary maintenance
therapy for all women with high-grade serous or endo-
metrioid disease. However, no OS results are available from
these studies nor data to address conservation of platinum-
sensitivity in women whose disease progressed while they
received PARPi maintenance or after completion of PARPi
maintenance. Those results should inform future treatment
decision-making. Given the expectation that early treat-
ment may confer the best outcome, maintenance therapy
with PARPi should be offered, with these caveats.
Doses recommended are the standard dose used for either
maintenance or treatment of existing disease and are
shown in Recommendation 2.0 with a qualiﬁcation in the
discussion for Recommendation 5.2. Eligibility for main-
tenance therapy includes women with CR/PR to initial
platinum-based therapy, to continue for up to 2 years
(olaparib) or 3 years (niraparib) in women with CRs who are
tolerating the drug. Longer treatment duration can be
considered for women initiating maintenance therapy with
a PR to platinum-based therapy and demonstrating clinical
improvement with PARPi treatment. The patient and her
physician should consider risk-beneﬁt balance for pro-
longed therapy. Switching PARPis to address tolerance is
acceptable; however, it is not acceptable to switch to
a different PARPi at the time of disease progression while
being treated with a PARPi.
Inclusion of bevacizumab with primary chemotherapy and
as maintenance has been evaluated for women with ad-
vanced stage III-IV, newly diagnosed EOC.31 It is recognized
that not all women with newly diagnosed EOC may have
results of a germline test at the initiation or even during
primary chemotherapy and may have been initiated on
a bevacizumab-containing therapy. Moving to a PARPi
maintenance per the FDA approval would then be difﬁcult.
The PAOLA-1 trial examined the role of olaparib mainte-
nance added on top of a regimen including bevacizumab
with primary chemotherapy and as maintenance. This
phase III trial demonstrated beneﬁt with addition of olaparib
for women with g/sBRCA and women with HRD score $ 42;
there was a 0.9-month difference for women with wild-type
disease and no evidence of HRD.24 Thus, addition of
a PARPi in the setting of a bevacizumab combination
primary therapy is a reasonable option for those women
who have attained a CR/PR to primary therapy. This rec-
ommendation is of moderate strength, because the added
value for women with wild-type disease is questionable and
may be informed further by the outcome of the ongoing
FDA review.
Only the VELIA study included a PARPi with chemotherapy
in initial treatment of ovarian cancer.10 Inclusion of veliparib
with chemotherapy and continued into maintenance
therapy for 30 cycles may be offered if veliparib becomes
commercially available.10 There are no data, to our
knowledge, to demonstrate inclusion during chemotherapy
followed by maintenance provides equal to or greater
beneﬁt, or reduced toxicity, compared with switch main-
tenance approaches. Furthermore, long-term safety data
for inclusion of veliparib with chemotherapy followed by
maintenance are needed, especially to address risk of AML/
MDS. Substitution of another PARPi in the VELIA regimen is
strongly discouraged, because safety, dose, and duration of
niraparib and rucaparib have not been deﬁned. Use of
olaparib requires a carboplatin dose modiﬁcation and at-
tenuation of the olaparib exposure per cycle.32-34 There are
also limited long-term safety data for the olaparib/carbo-
platin/paclitaxel regimen.34
CLINICAL QUESTION 3
Recurrent Ovarian Cancer: Second-Line or Greater
Maintenance and Treatment
Is PARPi monotherapy recommended for recurrent EOC?
If so:
a. In which settings (eg, second-line maintenance or
treatment of recurrent disease)?
b. At what dose and duration?
Recommendation 3.0
PARPi monotherapy maintenance (second-line or more)
may be offered to patients with EOC who have not already
received a PARPi and who have responded to platinum-
based therapy regardless of BRCA mutation status; treat-
ment is continued until progression of disease or toxicity
despite dose reductions and best supportive care.
• Options include: olaparib 300 mg every 12 hours;
rucaparib 600 mg every 12 hours; niraparib 200-
300 mg once daily.
(Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence
quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong)
Recommendation 3.1
Treatment with a PARPi should be offered to patients with
recurrent EOC who have not already received a PARPi and

a PARPi and whose tumor demonstrates genomic in-
stability, as determined by Myriad myChoice CDx, and has
not recurred within 6 months of platinum-based therapy
(Type: evidence based, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence
quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong).
Recommendation 3.3
PARPis are not recommended for treatment of BRCAwt or
platinum-resistant, recurrent EOC (Type: evidence based,
beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength
of recommendation: strong).
Literature review and analysis.
The systematic review
identiﬁed 13 trials in total, nine of which were open label,
phase II studies12,14-16,18,21,22,25,26 and four of which were
phase II or III controlled trials.11,17,19,23 In maintenance
therapy for the second-line or greater setting, Study 19,17,28
SOLO2,23 NOVA,19 and ARIEL311 all demonstrated signif-
icant efﬁcacy of PARPis compared with placebo (Table 3).
For recurrent disease, Study 42,14 SOLO3,22 Study 1016,
ARIEL2,25 and QUADRA21 all reported a signiﬁcant im-
provement in response and PFS in patients with BRCA
mutations (Table 4).
Clinical interpretation:
• Maintenance: Four trials investigated the efﬁcacy of
PARPi maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive
recurrent disease, and all showed an improvement
in PFS.11,17,19,23 Across all studies, women with
a g/sBRCA mutation had the most robust clinical
improvements. OS results just reported on the SOLO2
trial, which investigated olaparib monotherapy in pa-
tients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, g/sBRCA1/
2m EOC who had received $ 2 lines of chemotherapy.
The preplanned, ﬁnal, OS analysis with data maturity of
61% demonstrated that olaparib extended OS by
approximately 13 months compared with placebo
(38.8 v 51.7 months; HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.00;
P 5 .054) in the full analysis set and extended OS by
15 months with olaparib compared with placebo
(37.4 v 52.4 months; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97;
P 5 .031) in the prespeciﬁed sensitivity analysis of
patients with germline BRCA mutation.
• Recurrent disease: The ﬁrst approval for PARPis was
for use in the treatment setting for recurrent ovarian
cancer for PARPi-na¨ıve women. Olaparib is FDA approved
for the treatment of patients with gBRCAm ovarian, fal-
lopian, or primary peritoneal cancer who have received
$ 3 prior lines of chemotherapy. Rucaparib is approved
for the treatment of patients with gBRCAm–associated
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who
have been treated with $ 2 chemotherapy regimens.
Rucaparib yielded beneﬁt in ARIEL2 in a small cohort (n 5
5) of ovarian cancers with RAD51C or RAD51D mutations,
with three PRs and two patients with prolonged stable
disease for 8.3 and 11.0 months.25
The recently reported, single-arm QUADRA trial of nir-
aparib treatment in recurrent ovarian cancer met its pri-
mary end point demonstrating activity in fourth- and
ﬁfth-line treatment of patients with gBRCA and positive
for HRD who were PARPi na¨ıve and platinum sensitive to
their last platinum therapy (n 5 47). The study had an
ORR of 28% and a median duration of response of 9.2
months. It was approved in 2019 for patients with ad-
vanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
cancer treated with $ 3 prior chemotherapy regimens
who are PARPi na¨ıve and whose cancer is associated
with HRD-positive status determined using the myChoice
CDx as either tumor BRCA mutated and/or with a ge-
nomic instability score $ 42. Patients with HRD-positive
cancers but without BRCA mutations must have expe-
rienced progression at least 6 months after the last dose
of platinum-based therapy (ie, must have platinum-
sensitive disease).
Dosing recommendations for treatment with all three
agents are the same as deﬁned previously for use in
maintenance therapy. PARPi treatment is not generally
recommended for treatment of platinum-resistant cancer. It
has , 5% activity for treatment of BRCAwt, platinum-
resistant, recurrent EOC. Any use of PARPi in the
platinum-resistant setting is recommended to occur in the
setting of a clinical trial, whether as a single agent or in
chemotherapy, antiangiogenesis, or immunotherapy com-
binations. Nor should PARPis be readministered after
prior exposure and progression on PARPi therapy, because
there are no data to support that re-exposure in this setting
is beneﬁcial, and agent approval does not specify this
option. Clinical trial participation is encouraged.
CLINICAL QUESTION 4
PARPi in Combination
Are there settings where a PARPi in combination with
chemotherapy or other targeted therapy are recommended?
Recommendation 4.0
PARPis are not recommended for use in combination with
chemotherapy, other targeted agents, or immune-oncology
agents outside the context of a clinical trial. Clinical trial
participation is encouraged (Type: informal consensus,
beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evidence quality: insufﬁcient;
Strength of recommendation: moderate).
Clinical interpretation.
There are limited data and nu-
merous clinical trials now investigating the roles of PARPis
in combination with chemotherapy, antiangiogenesis, or
immunotherapies as treatment and in maintenance. The
addition of PARPi is safe given no signiﬁcant overlapping
toxicity for women receiving hormonal blockade (ie, aro-
matase inhibitor) for synchronous breast cancer. However,
there are no outcome data speciﬁc to this approach, to our
knowledge. There is an increasing need to understand
when and how to retreat with a PARPi, especially when

there has been progression while receiving a prior PARPi.
These unmet needs can only be clariﬁed with well-designed
randomized trials stratiﬁed for confounding elements such
as g/sBRCA status, prior exposure to platinum agents, prior
exposure to a PARPi, and accounting for AE risks. At this
time, it is not recommended to re-treat with PARPi, even for
patients with g/sBRCA platinum-sensitive disease, nor to
use combination therapy not in a clinical trial.
CLINICAL QUESTION 5
Adverse Events
How should clinicians manage the speciﬁc toxicities of the
various PARPis?
Recommendation 5.0 Anemia
a. Patients requiring a blood transfusion for symptom
relief and/or hemoglobin level , 8 g/dL should be
monitored. PARPi dose should be reduced with evi-
dence of repeated anemia to avoid multiple transfusions.
b. Patients with progressive anemia may be offered
growth factor per ASCO guidelines and physician and
patient comfort.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evi-
dence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation:
moderate).
Recommendation 5.1 Neutropenia
a. Growth factor is not indicated for use in patients re-
ceiving daily PARPi.
b. Neutropenia (grade 4 lasting $ 5-7 days or associated
with fever) should result in dose hold until recovery of
infection and granulocyte count, then dose may be
reduced. Growth factor support may be used in this
setting to support patient safety during the drug hold.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evi-
dence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation:
moderate),
Recommendation 5.2 Platelets
a. Thrombocytopenia is most common with nir-
aparib. Niraparib dosing guidelines should be used to
lower starting dose (200 mg) based on weight and
platelet count.
b. Discontinue PARPi for persistent thrombocytopenia or
signiﬁcant bleeding despite dose reduction.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evi-
dence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation:
moderate).
Recommendation 5.3 Persistent cytopenia
a. Evaluation for treatment-related MDS/AML should be
initiated in patients with persistent cytopenia that
occurs despite drug hold.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evi-
dence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation:
moderate).
Recommendation 5.4 Nausea
a. Many patients will have tachyphylaxis of nausea
symptoms over the ﬁrst cycle of therapy.
b. Persistent
nausea
requiring
daily
antiemetic
in-
tervention, causing a reduction in performance status,
and/or resulting in . 5% weight loss should result in
dose reduction.
(Type: informal consensus, beneﬁts outweigh harms; Evi-
dence quality: insufﬁcient; Strength of recommendation:
moderate).
Clinical interpretation.
PARPis, while generally well tol-
erated, have class- and agent-speciﬁc AEs, some of which
may lead to requirements for dose modiﬁcation (Table 6).
The most common of those include fatigue, anemia,
neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, persistent cytopenias, and
nausea. Other, less common, class-effect AEs include
vomiting and diarrhea, headache, elevation in levels of liver
function enzymes or creatinine, and the rarer, but also more
serious, pneumonitis and leukemia risks. Fatigue maybe
multifactorial, due to and/or representing cytopenias, stress
of nausea, and other elements, and may also be a conse-
quence of persistent grade 1 and/or grade 2 events. Thus,
because these are daily, continuously administered agents,
special attention should be paid to low-grade AEs, and any
grade 2 AE requiring a dose hold should be accompanied

by a dose reduction to minimize risk of a second dose hold
and further or persistent events or injury. Re-escalation or
resumption of initial dose is never recommended.
Anemia. Anemia is found across all PARPi use and is
characterized by a macrocytic phenotype with mean cor-
puscular volumes that can reach . 105 (units) but is not
a vitamin B12–dependent pernicious anemia functionally.
The anemia may present early or slowly progressively; have
the commonly associated effects of fatigue, decreased
exercise tolerance, and shortness of breath; and come on at
different levels of anemia across patients depending on
their underlying tolerance. Interventions include drug hold,
dose reduction, transfusion, and consideration of growth
factor support. The latter is recommended to follow existing
ASCO guidelines and appears to be used less commonly.
Ample experience demonstrates that drug holding without
associated other change will result in recurrence of the
anemia upon reinstitution of the agent. Thus, dose modi-
ﬁcation with or without transfusion to acutely ameliorate
effects of anemia is recommended.
Neutropenia. More variable across agents is the presence
and depth of neutropenia. All PARPis have the potential for
trilineage suppression; however, the severity of neutropenia
appears to vary across agents and patients. The degree of
prior marrow suppressive treatment(s) and bone marrow
reserve may also contribute to the tolerance of PARPi by the
bone marrow. The degree of myelosuppression has not
been shown to reach the levels deﬁned in the ASCO 2015
Guideline Update for prophylactic use of growth factor
support recommended for use with a . 20% risk of
neutropenia with fever.35 Thus, growth factor support is not
recommended for prophylactic use during PARPi therapy.
The 2015 guidelines also reinforce that growth factors
should be administered 24-72 hours after completion of the
chemotherapy, making consistent use of such agents not
feasible when administering a daily treatment regimen such
as a PARPi. Grade 4 neutropenia of $ 5-7 days or grade 3
with fever are indications for holding PARPi. Severe cir-
cumstances warrant consideration of short-acting growth
factor support, such as 3 days of neupogen, to mitigate
further decline. If that is done, PARPi should not be
restarted until resolution of fever, a granulocyte count of
$ 1,000/dL, and adequate time (ie, 48-72 hours) have
elapsed since the last dose of growth factor.
Thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia has been reported
with all commercially available PARPis, with variability in
frequency and depth across agents. Of the three approved
PARPis for ovarian cancer, niraparib had the greatest
impact on platelet counts, and the risk of thrombocytopenia
was greatest with initial exposures. Recommendations have
been proposed in the United States (pending FDA ap-
proval) and the United Kingdom (recommended in drug
insert) to modify doses as a function of age and/or weight.
United Kingdom recommendations are based on the
ﬁnding from the NOVA trial that there was a greater pro-
portion grade 3/4 adverse reactions including thrombo-
cytopenia in women in the lowest quartile of weight (# 58
kg) and state that a starting dose of 200 mg is recom-
mended for women weighing , 58 kg.19 Pending US
dosing recommendations indicate that 200 mg be the
starting dose for women weighing , 77 kg and/or with
a starting platelet count , 150,000/mL. Dose hold followed
by reduction is the recommended approach to grade 3/4
thrombocytopenia to avoid the requirement for platelet
transfusions. Patients who develop persistent or recurrent
thrombocytopenia while receiving a reduced dose or dose
hold of PARPi should be evaluated per the following section
on persistent cytopenias.
Persistent cytopenia, AML, MDS.
As with all DNA-
damaging agents, there is a risk for inducing injury, with
the bone marrow the most common site for such injury. It is
unclear the extent to which the PARPis contribute to un-
derlying injury that may have occurred from prior exposures
such as platinums, topoisomerase 1 and 2 inhibitors, and
antimetabolites, all of which have some reported risks. In
addition, women are living longer and thus having more
overall treatment exposures, which may contribute to ac-
cumulated injury. The most common ﬁrst sign is devel-
opment of a single or multiple persistent cytopenias. Such
a ﬁnding should trigger drug discontinuation and evaluation
for common underlying causes, such as evaluation of iron
stores, vitamin B12 level, and folate status, in the case of
persistent anemia. A low threshold should be used for
moving to bone marrow evaluation to rule out development
of MDS or AML, especially with persistent multilinear
cytopenia. Where appropriate, early hematology consul-
tation is recommended.
Nausea. Nausea occurs in various frequency and severity
across patients and PARPis. Many patients will have
tachyphylaxis of nausea symptoms during the ﬁrst cycle of
therapy, often without institution of antiemetic therapy or
dose reduction. Some patients may ﬁnd a light meal or
snack before taking a PARPi improves their symptoms.
Persistent nausea associated with vomiting, weight loss
. 5%, and/or reduction in performance status should be
evaluated to rule out other causes, such as bowel ob-
struction. Absent other causes, any situation with a re-
quirement for daily antiemetic intervention, causing
a reduction in performance status, and/or resulting in
. 5% weight loss should result in dose hold and then dose
reduction upon improvement and reinstitution.
PATIENT AND CLINICIAN COMMUNICATION
Women with advanced ovarian cancer considering treat-
ment or maintenance with a PARPi do so during a time of
rapidly emerging new data and complex regulatory ap-
provals. It is important to recognize that patients no longer
rely solely on their medical team for information and often
access other sources online, in print, or through social

media and support groups. Shared decision-making is
essential, and patients should be informed that the
evidence-based options for treatment (or maintenance), as
well as the potential beneﬁts and risks communicated by
the physician, are based on knowledge that continues to
evolve. Consideration of the patient’s preferences should be
supported in deciding the best course of treatment.
For patients faced with a decision to undergo potentially
years of treatment or maintenance with a PARPi, it is es-
sential that providers thoroughly explain the potential im-
pact on QoL during the initial 30- to 60-day adjustment
period and provide a plan for aggressive management of
AEs during this phase and beyond. Patients should also be
informed that a potential dose reduction may be reasonable
to manage AEs. Connection with other patients who have
already navigated adjustment to PARPis, through local or
on-line support networks, may increase tolerability and
adherence.
For recommendations and strategies to optimize patient-
clinician communication, see “Patient-Clinician Commu-
nication: American Society of Clinical Oncology Consensus
Guideline.”36
HEALTH DISPARITIES
Although ASCO clinical practice guidelines represent ex-
pert recommendations on the best practices in disease
management to provide the highest level of cancer care, it is
important to note that many patients have limited access to
medical care, and access to drugs can vary between
countries. Racial and ethnic disparities in health care
contribute signiﬁcantly to this problem in the United States.
A recent, large, population-based study of multigene testing
in patients with breast or ovarian cancer observed racial
disparities in genetic testing.37 While approximately 34% of
White women were tested, only about 22% of Black women
and 24% of Hispanic women received testing. Further-
more, racial/ethnic differences in pathogenic variants ob-
served in patients with ovarian cancer include BRCA1,
which is reported to be 1% in individuals of African descent,
7% in Whites and 16% in Hispanics.37 Patients with cancer
who are members of racial/ethnic minorities also suffer
disproportionately from comorbidities, experience more
substantial obstacles to receiving care, are more likely to be
uninsured, and are at greater risk of receiving care of poor
quality than other Americans.38-41 It is also recognized and
unfortunate that there are disparities in adherence to
treatment guidelines.42 As such, it is important for clinicians
to offer appropriate testing and to address patients’
questions, concerns, and/or misconceptions. Many other
patients lack access to care because of their geographic
location and distance from appropriate treatment facilities.
Awareness of these disparities in access to care should be
considered in the context of this clinical practice guideline,
and health care providers should strive to deliver the highest
level of cancer care to these vulnerable populations.
MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS
Creating
evidence-based
recommendations
to
inform
treatment of patients with additional chronic conditions,
a situation in which the patient may have $ 2 such con-
ditions—referred
to
as
multiple
chronic
conditions
(MCC)—is challenging. Patients with MCC are a complex
and heterogeneous population, making it difﬁcult to ac-
count for all the possible permutations to develop speciﬁc
recommendations for care. In addition, the best available
evidence for treating index conditions, such as cancer, is
often from clinical trials whose study selection criteria may
exclude these patients to avoid potential interaction effects
or confounding of results associated with MCC. As a result,
the reliability of outcome data from these studies may be
limited, thereby creating constraints for expert groups to
make recommendations for care in this heterogeneous
patient population.
Because many patients for whom guideline recommen-
dations apply present with MCC, any treatment plan needs
to take into account the complexity and uncertainty created
by the presence of MCC and highlights the importance of
shared decision-making regarding guideline use and
implementation. Therefore, in consideration of recom-
mended care for the target index condition, clinicians
should review all other chronic conditions present in the
patient and take those conditions into account when for-
mulating the treatment and follow-up plan.
In light of the aforementioned considerations, practice
guidelines should provide information on how to apply the
recommendations for patients with MCC, perhaps as
a qualifying statement for recommended care. This may
mean that some or all of the recommended care options are
modiﬁed or not applied, as determined by best practice in
consideration of any MCC.
COST IMPLICATIONS
Increasingly, individuals with cancer are required to pay
a larger proportion of their treatment costs through de-
ductibles and coinsurance.43,44 Higher patient out-of-
pocket costs are a barrier to initiating and adhering to
recommended cancer treatments.45,46 PARPis are costlier
than other available therapies, 18.8, 6.9, and 2.2-2.7 times
costlier than paclitaxel, pembrolizumab, and bevacizumab,
respectively. Patients’ out-of-pocket costs may vary
depending on insurance coverage. Coverage may originate
in the medical or pharmacy beneﬁt, which may have dif-
ferent cost-sharing arrangements. Patients should be
aware that different products may be preferred or covered
by their particular insurance plan. Even with the same
insurance plan, the price may vary between different
pharmacies. While most insurance carriers will provide
some coverage for PARPis, the patient’s copayment can
remain prohibitive, nonetheless. Medicare, which is used
by many patients with ovarian cancer, given that the

disease largely affects older women, does cover most
PARPis. The amount of coverage and the size of copay,
however, vary from state to state. When discussing ﬁnancial
issues and concerns, patients should be made aware of any
ﬁnancial counseling services available to address this
complex and heterogeneous landscape.47
Discussion of cost can be an important part of shared
decision-making.47 Clinicians should discuss with patients
the use of less expensive alternatives when it is practical
and feasible for treatment of the patient’s disease and when
there are $ 2 treatment options that are comparable in
terms of beneﬁts and harms.47
EXTERNAL REVIEW AND OPEN COMMENT
The draft recommendations were released to the public for
open comment from February 11, 2020, through February
25, 2020. Response categories of “Agree as written,”
“Agree with suggested modiﬁcations,” and “Disagree. See
comments” were captured for every proposed recom-
mendation, with 58 written comments received. A total of
12 respondents, who had not previously reviewed the
recommendations, either agreed or agreed with slight
modiﬁcations to the vast majority of the recommendations.
Expert Panel members reviewed comments from all
sources and determined whether to maintain original draft
recommendations, revise with minor language changes, or
consider major recommendation revisions. All changes
were incorporated prior to Clinical Practice Guideline
Committee review and approval.
The draft was submitted to two external reviewers with
content expertise. It was rated as high quality, and it was
agreed it would be useful in practice. Speciﬁc comments
were reviewed by the Expert Panel and integrated into the
ﬁnal manuscript before submission to JCO.
GUIDELINE IMPLEMENTATION
ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across
health settings. Each ASCO guideline includes a member
from ASCO’s Practice Guideline Implementation Network
(PGIN) on the panel. The additional role of this PGIN rep-
resentative on the guideline panel is to assess the suitability of
the recommendations to implementation in the community
setting and also to identify any other barrier to implementation
a reader should be aware of. Barriers to implementation
include the need to increase awareness of the guideline
recommendations among front-line practitioners and survi-
vors of cancer and caregivers, and also to provide adequate
services in the face of limited resources. The guideline
Bottom Line box was designed to facilitate implementation of
recommendations. This guideline will be distributed widely
through the ASCO PGIN. ASCO guidelines are posted on the
ASCO website and most often published in JCO.
LIMITATION OF THE RESEARCH AND FUTURE RESEARCH
A major limitation of these guidelines is their focus on
women who are PARPi na¨ıve. The physician and patient
need to consider the full lifetime of the patient and disease
and weigh the data beneﬁts and risks, especially given the
lack of an OS beneﬁt to date. A critical unmet need is to
understand the opportunities and where the beneﬁts may
be for re-exposure to a PARPi after an initial good response
and in combinations after a progression outcome. Pre-
clinical development is moving rapidly and some empirical
and some data-driven clinical trials have begun. Reuse of
a PARPi should only be considered in such a trial situation
until data develop to guide evidence-based clinical care.
Future clinical trials that examine PARPi timing within the
treatment life cycle and optimal duration of treatment could
help establish the best risk-beneﬁt balance practice pattern
for PARPi use in the management of EOC.
