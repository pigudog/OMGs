Your responsibility
The recommendations in this guideline represent the view of NICE, arrived at after careful
consideration of the evidence available. When exercising their judgement, professionals
and practitioners are expected to take this guideline fully into account, alongside the
individual needs, preferences and values of their patients or the people using their service.
It is not mandatory to apply the recommendations, and the guideline does not override the
responsibility to make decisions appropriate to the circumstances of the individual, in
consultation with them and their families and carers or guardian.
All problems (adverse events) related to a medicine or medical device used for treatment
or in a procedure should be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency using the Yellow Card Scheme.
Local commissioners and providers of healthcare have a responsibility to enable the
guideline to be applied when individual professionals and people using services wish to
use it. They should do so in the context of local and national priorities for funding and
developing services, and in light of their duties to have due regard to the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, to advance equality of opportunity and to reduce health
inequalities. Nothing in this guideline should be interpreted in a way that would be
inconsistent with complying with those duties.
Commissioners and providers have a responsibility to promote an environmentally
sustainable health and care system and should assess and reduce the environmental
impact of implementing NICE recommendations wherever possible.

This guideline is the basis of QS18.
Overview
This guideline covers assessing the familial and genetic risk of having a pathogenic variant
associated with ovarian cancer in adults.
In women, trans men and non-binary people with female reproductive organs (ovaries,
fallopian tubes and/or a uterus), having a pathogenic variant increases the risk of
developing ovarian cancer (familial ovarian cancer). As well as risk assessment, this
guideline covers risk management and decision-making support for people born with
female reproductive organs who have, or are at risk of having, a pathogenic variant
associated with ovarian cancer.
Men, trans women and non-binary people born with male reproductive organs cannot
develop ovarian cancer, but if they have a pathogenic variant associated with ovarian
cancer, they can pass the variant on to their children, and may be at risk of developing
other cancers. This guideline covers risk assessment, but it does not cover managing risk
or decision-making support for people born with male reproductive organs.
NICE has also produced a guideline on the recognition and initial management of ovarian
cancer.
Who is it for?
• Healthcare professionals working in primary, secondary and tertiary care
• Cancer alliances
• Commissioners (including clinical commissioning groups and NHS England specialised
commissioning)
• Voluntary sector organisations
• Adults (18 years and older) with a genetic risk of having a pathogenic variant
associated with ovarian cancer, and their families and carers (where appropriate)

Recommendations
People have the right to be involved in discussions and make informed decisions
about their care, as described in NICE's information on making decisions about your
care.
Making decisions using NICE guidelines explains how we use words to show the
strength (or certainty) of our recommendations, and has information about
prescribing medicines (including off-label use), professional guidelines, standards
and laws (including on consent and mental capacity), and safeguarding.
1.1 Organisation of services
Commissioners and service providers in all settings (primary
care, genetics services, gynaecology oncology and familial ovarian
cancer multidisciplinary services)
1.1.1
Commissioners and service providers should ensure that there are referral
pathways to genetics services and gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary
services for people at risk of having a pathogenic variant associated with ovarian
cancer. Such pathways can be facilitated by providing, for example:
• clear referral criteria (see recommendation 1.3.1 in the section on assessing
the risk of having a pathogenic variant)
• an online referral form (to be completed by the referring clinician)
• a family history questionnaire (to be completed by the person) that
accompanies the referral form
• information and support (see the section on information and support).
1.1.2
Commissioners and service providers should raise awareness of which groups of
people may be at risk of having a pathogenic variant associated with ovarian

cancer.
1.1.3
Commissioners and service providers should ensure that there is training and
information available for healthcare professionals on equality and inclusiveness
issues that could improve access to services, for example, for people who:
• are from under-represented or underserved communities who may need
more support to access services (for example, people who are physically
disabled, people with neurodevelopmental conditions or a learning disability,
people from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds, and people who
are LGBTQ+)
• may not come forward for testing because they do not realise that they may
be at risk of having a pathogenic variant associated with ovarian cancer (for
example, men, trans women and non-binary people born with male
reproductive organs).
Primary care services
1.1.4
Primary care should be responsible for:
• providing information and support (see the section on information and
support)
• referral to genetics services and other specialist services (see
recommendation 1.1.1 and recommendation 1.3.1 in the section on assessing
the risk of having a pathogenic variant).
Genetics services
1.1.5
Genetics services should be responsible for:
• providing information and support (see the section on information and
support)
• assessing the risk of having a pathogenic variant for people who do not have
ovarian cancer

• genetic counselling and genetic testing for people who do not have ovarian
cancer
• genetic counselling and genetic testing for people diagnosed with non-
epithelial ovarian cancer (see recommendation 1.4.6 in the section on people
with ovarian cancer)
• arranging cascade testing of relatives, if appropriate
• assessing the risk of developing ovarian cancer
• discussing potential management options
• referral (if needed) to the familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team and
other specialist services.
Gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team
1.1.6
The gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team should be responsible for
mainstream genetic counselling and genetic testing for people with invasive
epithelial ovarian cancer.
Familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team
1.1.7
The familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team should be responsible for:
• clinical care pathways and management protocols
• the lifelong care of people at risk of familial ovarian cancer (those with a
pathogenic variant or those above a risk threshold; see the section on criteria
for genetic counselling and genetic testing)
• providing information and support (see the section on information and
support)
• assessing the risk of developing ovarian cancer
• discussing potential management options (for example, risk-reducing

surgery)
• carrying out surveillance and reviews
• liaising with other services and healthcare professionals, including primary
care and specialist services (see recommendation 1.1.9)
• contributing to local and network audits
• facilitating access to clinical trials.
1.1.8
The familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team should have a designated lead
clinician, and include healthcare professionals with expertise in areas including:
• clinical genetics
• gynaecology
• gynaecological oncology.
1.1.9
The familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team should have established
relationships with, and agreed referral pathways to, other specialist services such
as:
• psychological services
• menopause services
• fertility services
• breast cancer risk management services
• ovarian cancer services
• colorectal cancer services.

1.2.8
In genetics services, a healthcare professional with skills and experience in
information provision and shared decision making specifically related to genetics
and cancer risk should offer genetic counselling to people who meet the referral
criteria for genetic testing. See the sections on assessing the risk of having a
pathogenic variant and criteria for genetic counselling and genetic testing.
1.2.9
Take into account the following factors when deciding whether to offer face-to-
face or remote (for example, video call, telephone) genetic counselling:
• the person's preference
• the decision that needs to be made (for example, genetic testing or risk-
reducing surgery)
• accessibility needs (for example, geographic location, digital access,
language or communication impairment, participation of family members in
other locations)
• the need for an interpreter.
1.2.10
Consider giving information in a group session before an individual genetic
counselling session.
1.2.11
Consider using a patient decision aid (for example, an app) alongside genetic
counselling to support shared decision making. See the recommendations on
patient decision aids in the NICE guideline on shared decision making.

Risk of developing ovarian cancer
• Information about the person's risk of developing familial ovarian cancer, how the
risk is assessed, what their personal risk estimate means, and other factors that
could increase or decrease the risk.
• Information and support to aid shared decision making.
Reproductive choices
• Information about the likelihood of passing down the pathogenic variant to their
children.
• Information about the impact of risk-reducing surgery on fertility.
• Information about the availability of fertility preservation by storing eggs or
embryos.
• Information about the availability of pre-implantation genetic testing of embryos
to avoid passing down the genetic risk to their children.
Risk-reducing surgery
• Information about risk-reducing surgery and what it involves.
• Advice that risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the most reliable
way to substantially reduce the likelihood of developing ovarian cancer and
therefore improve life expectancy, but that there will still be a small residual risk.
• Information that, if risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is appropriate,
it is because of a pathogenic variant associated with ovarian cancer, or a family
history that has been shown to increase risk.
• Information about the timing of risk-reducing surgery and different surgical
procedures (also see the recommendations on risk-reducing mastectomy in the
NICE guideline on familial breast cancer).
• The possible biopsychosocial and sexual consequences of risk-reducing surgery.

the person's life, for example, that risk-reducing surgery will lead to early
menopause (if premenopausal) and the symptoms they may experience, hormone
replacement therapy (HRT), impact on sex life and body image, and fertility (see
also the section on people with cancer who wish to preserve fertility in the NICE
guideline on fertility problems).
• Information about ovarian cancer surveillance if they choose to delay or not have
risk-reducing surgery – see recommendation 1.8.6 for details of the information
that should be given.
• Information about the risk of other cancers (for example, primary peritoneal,
breast, pancreas, prostate or bowel cancer).
For a short explanation of why the committee made this recommendation and how it
might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on information and support
in specialist services if a person has a pathogenic variant or a strong family history of
ovarian cancer.

• evidence review E: optimal methods of assessing the absolute risk of having a
pathogenic variant
• evidence review K: benefits and risks of surveillance
• evidence review N: risk-reducing surgery.
1.3 Assessing the risk of having a pathogenic variant
These recommendations are for anyone who has a risk of having a pathogenic variant
associated with ovarian cancer. This includes women, men, trans people and non-binary
people.

1.3.1
Healthcare professionals in primary care and secondary care should refer people
for genetic counselling and genetic testing if any of the following apply:
• they have a first-degree relative with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer
• they have a maternal or paternal second-degree relative with a diagnosis of
ovarian cancer (this includes people with an unaffected intervening blood
relative)
• they meet the criteria for genetic testing as set out in the section on criteria
for genetic counselling and genetic testing
• they are from an at-risk population
• they have been identified through cascade testing
• they have a diagnosis of ovarian cancer as outlined in recommendation 1.4.6
and have not already had mainstream genetic testing.
1.3.2
If a person had a direct-to-consumer genetic test and is reported to have a
pathogenic variant for which NHS testing is offered (for example, BRCA),
healthcare professionals should liaise with the regional NHS genetics service to
discuss whether referral is appropriate.
1.3.3
Genetics services should assess the probability of having a pathogenic variant
using a calculation method with demonstrated accuracy, such as the Manchester
scoring system, CanRisk (BOADICEA), BRCAPRO, or criteria based on specific
clinical circumstances or a verified family history that are designed for the
threshold used for testing.

Family history of ovarian cancer
These recommendations are for anyone who has a risk of having a pathogenic variant
associated with ovarian cancer. This includes women, men, trans people and non-binary
people.
1.4.1
Genetics services should offer genetic counselling and genetic testing to anyone
who:

If a person has not had ovarian cancer, genetics services should offer genetic
counselling and genetic testing if:
• they are a second-degree or more distant blood relative of a person with a
known pathogenic variant and
• testing of an intervening blood relative is impossible or not clinically
appropriate (for example, consent is declined).
1.4.4
If a person has a personal or family history of breast cancer, also see the NICE
guideline on familial breast cancer, in particular the sections on the clinical
significance of a family history of breast cancer, and referral to a specialist
genetic clinic.

Recognise and raise awareness that people from the following populations (with
at least 1 grandparent from the respective population), have a higher risk of
having a founder pathogenic variant associated with familial ovarian cancer, so
should be offered referral for genetic counselling and genetic testing for this
variant, even if the person has no family or personal history of cancer:
• Ashkenazi Jewish
• Sephardi Jewish
• Greenlander.
Also see the NHS Jewish BRCA Testing Programme, which offers BRCA
testing to people with Jewish ancestry.

1.6 Assessing the risk of developing ovarian cancer
These recommendations are for women, trans men and non-binary people born with any
female reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus).
1.6.1
If a person is under the care of genetics services or a familial ovarian cancer
multidisciplinary team and has not had genetic testing, the service or team
should offer to assess their risk of developing ovarian cancer.
1.6.2
If a person has a pathogenic variant associated with an increased risk of ovarian
cancer, the familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team should offer to assess
their risk of developing ovarian cancer.
1.6.3
When assessing a person's risk of developing ovarian cancer:
• use a tool with demonstrated accuracy that includes their age, family history
of ovarian and other cancers, and their pathogenic variant (such as CanRisk)
• inform the person that there are other factors that could also increase or
decrease their risk when using a tool or method that includes only limited
information (for example, their age and pathogenic variant)
• take into account factors that may not be accurately assessed by tools, for
example, parity, use of the combined oral contraceptive pill, endometriosis,
and whether relatives have only ovarian cancer.
1.6.4
When discussing a person's risk of developing ovarian cancer:
• provide a summary in the person's preferred format that includes their
personal risk estimate and

These recommendations are for women, trans men and non-binary people born with any
female reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus), and who are at risk of
epithelial ovarian cancer.
Aspirin
1.7.1
Do not offer aspirin for the sole purpose of reducing ovarian cancer risk.
1.7.2
For recommendations on the use of aspirin for people with Lynch syndrome, see
the section on reduction in risk of colorectal cancer in people with Lynch
syndrome in the NICE guideline on colorectal cancer.
Combined oral contraceptives
1.7.3
Only consider the combined oral contraceptive pill to reduce the risk of ovarian
cancer:
• if the reduction in the risk of developing ovarian cancer outweighs the

increased risk of developing breast cancer and
• after taking into account the timing of any risk-reducing surgery (mastectomy
or salpingo-oophorectomy; see the section on risk-reducing surgery).
In March 2024, this was an off-label use of combined oral contraceptives.
See NICE's information on prescribing medicines.

1.8 Risk-reducing surgery
These recommendations are for women, trans men and non-binary people born with any
female reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus), and who are at risk of
epithelial ovarian cancer.
Factors to take into account when considering risk-reducing
surgery
1.8.1
Only offer risk-reducing surgery to people who have:
• completed their family or are not planning to conceive naturally (that is, they
would only conceive using assisted reproduction) and
• a total lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 5% or over because they have:
－ a pathogenic variant associated with familial ovarian cancer or

－ a strong family history of ovarian cancer.
1.8.2
When discussing risk-reducing surgery, provide information and support in line
with:
• table 3 on information and support in specialist services if a person has a
pathogenic variant or a strong family history of ovarian cancerand
• table 1 on information and support about familial ovarian cancer in all
settings.
1.8.3
When discussing risk-reducing surgery, take into account psychological factors
(such as anxiety) that could influence decision making. Discuss psychological
support services available and, if needed, refer the person for psychological
support before surgery.
1.8.4
When discussing risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy surgery with
people who are premenopausal:
• offer specialist menopause counselling before and after surgery and
• provide information and support to aid shared decision making (also see the
section on information and support, in particular table 3 on information and
support in specialist services if a person has a pathogenic variant or a strong
family history of ovarian cancer, and the section on hormone replacement
therapy after risk-reducing surgery).
1.8.5
Refer people who have bi-allelic pathogenic variants in mismatch repair genes
(for example, homozygous PMS2), to a specialist tertiary team for discussions
about risk-reducing surgery.
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on factors to take into
account when considering risk-reducing surgery.

Types of risk-reducing surgery and timing in relation to the
person's specific pathogenic variant
The recommendations are for risk-reducing surgery related to ovarian cancer. For people
who have a pathogenic variant that also increases their risk of breast cancer and are
considering risk-reducing mastectomy, also see the NICE guideline on familial breast
cancer.
1.8.6
Offer risk-reducing surgery that is appropriate for the person's age, specific
pathogenic variant and family history (including age of onset of any confirmed
ovarian cancers in the family), after discussing the person's individual
circumstances with the familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team. See table 5
on timing and types of risk-reducing surgery for people with a pathogenic variant
that increases the risk of ovarian cancer.

for people (no earlier than 45 years) who have:
• a heterozygous PMS2 pathogenic variant and
• no family history of ovarian cancer.
1.8.8
If a person with a heterozygous PMS2 pathogenic variant has been offered total
hysterectomy to prevent endometrial cancer, consider additional bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy depending on verified family history of ovarian cancer,
age and menopausal status.
1.8.9
Consider risk-reducing surgery in people younger than the ages in table 5 on
timing and types of risk-reducing surgery after carrying out an individualised risk
assessment (including an assessment of menopausal symptoms) and providing
information and support to aid shared decision making (also see the section on
information and support).
1.8.10
Only offer risk-reducing bilateral salpingectomy with delayed oophorectomy as
part of a clinical trial.
1.8.11
Do not carry out risk-reducing total hysterectomy in people with pathogenic
variants other than MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, unless a personalised risk
assessment shows a high risk of endometrial cancer that would necessitate
hysterectomy or there is another gynaecological indication for hysterectomy.
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on types of risk-
reducing surgery and timing in relation to the person's specific pathogenic variant.

asymptomatic ovarian cancer.
1.8.13
Before carrying out a risk-reducing hysterectomy, perform an endometrial biopsy
to minimise the risk of missing asymptomatic endometrial cancer.
Referral to the gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team
1.8.14
If asymptomatic cancer is identified by preoperative investigation or
postoperative histopathological or cytopathological analysis, refer the person to
the gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team (see the section on the
gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team).
During risk-reducing surgery
1.8.15
Carry out risk-reducing minimal access surgery, unless a laparotomy is more
clinically appropriate.
1.8.16
Take peritoneal washings during risk-reducing surgery for cytological examination
to test for the presence of malignant cells.
1.8.17
If any suspicious lesions are found outside the organs being removed, take a
biopsy if it is feasible and safe to do.

Ovarian cancer surveillance by the familial ovarian cancer
multidisciplinary team for people who choose to delay or not
have risk-reducing surgery
These recommendations are for women, trans men, non-binary people born with any
female reproductive organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus).
1.8.18
If a person is at risk of developing ovarian cancer and chooses to delay or not
have risk-reducing surgery, discuss their reasons and explain that:
• they have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer and that the only
way to reduce their risk is to have risk-reducing surgery
• delaying risk-reducing surgery should only be seen as a short-term option
• regular surveillance does not reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer
• although regular surveillance means that ovarian cancer may be detected
earlier, they should not view surveillance as an alternative to risk-reducing
surgery (because there is little evidence on whether this leads to improved
outcomes and saves lives)
• surveillance will involve them having a blood test every 4 months to check
their level of the protein CA125 (cancer antigen 125), with an algorithm to
analyse results, and a review at least once a year to discuss the
recommendation of having risk-reducing surgery
• there is a possibility of getting a false-positive or false-negative test result.
1.8.19
The familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team (see the section on familial
ovarian cancer multidisciplinary teams) should only consider surveillance for
people in the following groups who are at risk of developing ovarian cancer but
who choose to delay or not have risk-reducing surgery (see also table 5 on timing
and types of risk-reducing surgery):
• over 35 and have a BRCA1 pathogenic variant or
• over 40 and have a BRCA2 pathogenic variant or
• over 45 and have RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1 and PALB2 pathogenic variants.

1.8.20
If carrying out surveillance (see recommendation 1.8.19), the familial ovarian
cancer multidisciplinary team should:
• carry out serial 4-monthly CA125 longitudinal testing using an algorithm with
demonstrated accuracy (for example, the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm
[ROCA] Test)
• coordinate, audit and interpret CA125 testing using a call and recall system
• have a review appointment with the person at least once a year to discuss
the recommendation of having risk-reducing surgery (see the section on risk-
reducing surgery).
For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how
they might affect practice, see the rationale and impact section on ovarian cancer
surveillance in secondary care for people who choose to delay or not have risk-
reducing surgery.

1.9 Pathology protocol for handling specimens from
risk-reducing surgery
1.9.1
Submit all ovaries and fallopian tubes for histological examination using a
SEE-FIM (Sectioning and Extensively Examining the FIMbriated End) protocol.
1.9.2
Carry out immunohistochemistry (p53 and Ki67/MIB1) only if a premalignant or
malignant lesion is suspected on morphological examination.
1.9.3
Submit the adnexa in separate, appropriately labelled specimen containers so
that the laterality is available to the pathologist. Include this information in the
pathology report.

1.10 Hormone replacement therapy after risk-
reducing surgery
These recommendations are for women, trans men and non-binary people who have had
risk-reducing surgery on female reproductive organs.
1.10.1
Offer hormone replacement therapy (HRT) until the average age of menopause
(usually around 51 years) for people who:
• have not had breast cancer and
• have had risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy before the average
age of menopause.
1.10.2
Liaise with the person's breast cancer care team before offering HRT to people
who:
• have had breast cancer and
• have had risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
1.10.3
When offering HRT to people who meet the criteria in recommendation 1.10.1:
• use combined HRT for people who have a uterus

• use oestrogen-only HRT for people who do not have a uterus
• start HRT as soon as clinically appropriate after surgery
• consider the insertion of a levonorgestrel intrauterine system at time of
surgery
• discuss the individual risks and benefits of HRT use beyond the average age
of menopause.

Cascade testing
A systematic process to identify individuals within a family at risk of developing a
hereditary condition. Cascade testing begins with finding a pathogenic variant through
testing (such as multigene panel testing) in 1 family member, usually affected by the
condition. Then, testing just for the specific family variant is extended to blood relatives.
This process is repeated as more affected individuals or pathogenic variant carriers are
identified.
First-degree relative
Mother, father, daughter, son, sister or brother.
Founder pathogenic variant
A genetic alteration observed with high frequency in a group that is or was geographically
or culturally isolated, in which 1 or more of the ancestors was a carrier of the altered gene.
Genetic testing
The study of a person's DNA in order to identify potentially disease-causing differences
(pathogenic variants) or susceptibility to particular diseases or abnormalities.
Germline testing
A type of genetic test that looks for inherited mutations that are present in the DNA of
every cell of the body and have been present since birth.
Intervening blood relative
A relative on the same side of the family who is more closely related to the family member
with ovarian cancer than the person themselves.
Mainstream pre-test counselling and genetic testing
Pre-test counselling, consent and genetic testing being undertaken at the point of care by
a member of the gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team rather than genetics

services.
Mismatch repair genes
Mismatch repair (MMR) genes code for proteins that are involved in correcting mistakes
made when DNA is copied in a cell. MMR-deficient cells usually have many DNA
alterations, which may lead to cancer.
Pathogenic variant
A genetic alteration that increases a person's susceptibility or predisposition to a certain
disease or disorder. If someone has a pathogenic variant, they are sometimes known as a
'carrier'. This is because they 'carry', and can pass on to their children, a pathogenic
variant associated with a disease (or trait) that is inherited in an autosomal dominant,
autosomal recessive manner, even though they do not show symptoms of that disease (or
features of that trait). The likelihood of having the pathogenic variant is also known as
their 'carrier probability'.
In this guideline, the term 'pathogenic variant' refers to the presence of a pathogenic
variant or 'likely pathogenic variant' (which is a variant with strong evidence that suggests
it is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer).
Second-degree relative
Grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, half-sister or half-brother.
Strong family history of ovarian cancer
A person has a strong family history of ovarian cancer if they have 1 or more first-degree
relatives (for example, a mother, sister or daughter) on the same side of their family (the
mother's or father's side of the family) with ovarian cancer.
Third-degree relative
Great grandparent, great grandchild, great aunt, great uncle, first cousin, grandnephew or
grandniece.

Rationale and impact
These sections briefly explain why the committee made the recommendations and how
they might affect practice or services.
Organisation of services
Recommendations 1.1.1 to 1.1.9
Why the committee made the recommendations
There was limited evidence, with a small number of studies and uncertainties about the
effect size and the way the studies were conducted, so the committee based the
recommendations on the evidence and their knowledge and experience.
Commissioners and service providers in all settings (primary care, genetics
services, gynaecology oncology and familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary
services)
The committee discussed their experience of variations in how people are referred from
healthcare professionals, for example, whether people are referred first to specialist
gynaecological services or directly to genetic specialist services. They decided to
recommend direct referral to make services more efficient, together with ways of making
the referral process smoother (including clearer referral criteria).
The committee discussed their experience of why people who may be at risk of having a
pathogenic variant associated with ovarian cancer do not access services. They agreed
that people from under-represented or underserved groups may know that the guideline
applies to them but may need more support to access services. This could include people
who are physically disabled, people with neurodevelopmental conditions or a learning
disability, people from Black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds, and people who are
LGBTQ+. In addition, people may not realise that they may be at risk of having a
pathogenic variant associated with ovarian cancer because they cannot develop ovarian
cancer, for example, men, trans women and non-binary people born with male
reproductive organs. The committee agreed that these groups need encouragement to
discuss referral to genetics services. The committee further noted that healthcare

conditions#notice-of-rights).

[PAGE 41/68]

professionals are not always aware of the potential barriers, and agreed that training and
information would help raise awareness.
The committee also noted that there is an overall lack of awareness, which is a barrier to
identification of people at risk. They decided, based on their experience, that it should be
within the remit of commissioners and service providers to raise awareness both among
healthcare professionals and the general public. A lack of knowledge about who may be
eligible (for example, people from at-risk populations) could lead to a delay in assessment
and identification of people at risk, and this has potentially serious consequences, such as
the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Including this information in continuing education
programmes and having public awareness initiatives could be ways to help raise
awareness.
Primary care services
The committee discussed that primary care has limited capacity to seek out potential
index cases. However, if a family history is known (including family history from a
population with increased risk), a person is known to be from an at-risk population or a
person has ovarian cancer, GPs can refer people directly to genetics services. The
committee also noted that information and support should be provided in primary care to
enable people to make informed decisions.
Genetics services
In the committee's experience, there is little variation in the responsibilities of genetics
services because their services are specified by NHS England commissioning guidance for
medical genetics services. The committee agreed to list the main responsibilities so that
people know what to expect when they are being referred.
The committee discussed whether rarer types of ovarian cancer would be the
responsibility of genetics services or gynaecology oncology services. It was agreed that
the care of these types of genetic conditions (see the non-epithelial ovarian cancers listed
in recommendation 1.4.6) is very specialised and that therefore genetic counselling and
genetic testing should be within the remit of genetics services.
Gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team

services run more efficiently and faster, the committee agreed that mainstream genetic
counselling and genetic testing of anyone with a histopathological diagnosis of epithelial
ovarian cancer should be carried out by their gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary
team.
Familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team
Having a pathogenic variant or being above a threshold for testing leads to many decisions
having to be made during the person's life, for example, in relation to fertility and risk-
reducing surgery. The committee acknowledged that services run more effectively when
roles and responsibilities are defined so that staff and people using the services know
what to expect. They noted that the person's care would need to be coordinated because
different services may become relevant to them at different points in their life (including,
for example, providing information and support, and carrying out reviews). The committee
decided that a multidisciplinary approach would be beneficial and that this should
continue throughout the person's life. They clarified that the person would usually see the
appropriate person relevant to their circumstances and would not usually see the entire
team.
Based on their experience, the committee specified the expertise that is essential for the
familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team (core expertise that is always required) and
the other services that the multidisciplinary team would need access to, such as
menopause services.
How the recommendations might affect services
The committee discussed that some of these services already exist but that there is
variation in practice in how referral between them takes place and how they are set up.
The committee noted that broader eligibility criteria for genetic testing may result in more
pressure on existing services, such as primary care. However, people are generally
responsible for the completion of their family history questionnaires and specialist service
referrals can be completed quickly online, which may help to mitigate some of the
pressure on primary care services.
Not all trusts have dedicated familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary teams, and there is
variation in practice. The committee noted that similar teams already exist for breast
cancer, and have improved outcomes. Although the recommendations may incur initial

set-up costs, these will be offset by improved outcomes. The recommendations will also
standardise service organisation. The committee also noted that, although access to
specialists is essential and the overall care is coordinated by them, specialists do not need
to be located in a single clinic, potentially mitigating the resource impact on services.
Return to recommendations
Information and support
Information and support about familial ovarian cancer in all
settings
Recommendations 1.2.1 to 1.2.6 and table 1
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee based their recommendations on qualitative evidence.
There was evidence that although people want information tailored to their individual
situation, preferences and needs, this does not always happen. In addition, people want
information at the most appropriate time, as well as several opportunities for discussions.
There was also evidence that information about risks can be difficult to digest for people
and varies according to each person's circumstances. There was evidence highlighting
that people can feel overwhelmed by the volume and complexity of information and feel
that it is not always sufficiently individualised. There was also evidence about the
importance of involving families. The committee agreed the importance of providing
sufficient information on an ongoing basis, tailored to the person's needs, so that people
can make informed choices.
The evidence showed that rather than receiving all information at once, which can be
overwhelming, people appreciate having opportunities to review their decisions at key
stages in the pathway. The committee noted that people would need to know how they
can access services to make these discussions possible, and recommended providing
opportunities to address this.
There was evidence that the considerable psychological impact is not always sufficiently
addressed, so the committee recommended that healthcare professionals ask people

[PAGE 44/68]

about their emotional health and wellbeing at each appointment. This means that onward
referral to genetic counselling or psychological services can be arranged if needed, for
example, in situations where there is anxiety around testing or severe emotional distress.
There was evidence that many people believe that genetic risk only affects women and
people born with female reproductive organs. The committee agreed that this perpetuates
a lack of clarity around the risk for men, trans women and non-binary people born with
male reproductive organs, and discussed the need to raise awareness about the risks.
Based on their knowledge and experience, and the equality impact assessment for this
guideline, the committee highlighted that some groups may need additional support to
access services, for example, by having online rather than in-person appointments.
To emphasise the need for standard information in all settings and the content of this
information, the committee highlighted key information that should be given to people.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee agreed that it is current practice to provide information and support but
noted that there is variation in when, what and how often it is provided. The
recommendations should lead to greater consistency. Although this may take up additional
time, it will allow people to better understand their risk and make informed choices. For
example, appropriate information and support at the right time may mean a person
choosing to have risk-reducing surgery, which will substantially reduce their cancer risk
and associated healthcare costs. Also, existing processes to provide similar information
and support to those at risk of familial breast cancer should help lessen the resource
impact.

experience. They discussed that informed choices can only be made if good information is
provided, and agreed that information and support is needed when people come to
genetics services, so summarised the information that should be provided as a minimum.
Evidence showed that, compared with usual care, genetic counselling is associated with a
higher uptake of the options being considered and higher scores on a knowledge
questionnaire about ovarian cancer risk (it could be inferred that better knowledge would
lead to a higher-quality decision). The committee acknowledged that genetic counselling
would not be needed by everyone but recommended it for people who meet the referral
criteria for genetic testing.
Evidence comparing telephone with face-to-face genetic counselling showed no
differences in outcomes apart from a higher uptake of options with face-to-face
counselling. Economic evidence also showed telephone counselling to be a cost-effective
option. The committee noted that the evidence was from 2014 and that online genetic
counselling has become a lot more common since the COVID-19 pandemic. They agreed
that online or face-to-face counselling should be offered. They also noted that certain
factors may influence which option is most preferable. For example, face-to-face
counselling may be more appropriate if an interpreter is needed, whereas online
counselling may be more appropriate if family members in a different geographical location
are attending the session.
The committee considered clinical and economic evidence that compared a group session
in which a video was shown before individual genetic counselling sessions, with individual
sessions alone. The committee noted that there were not many clinical differences but
that there were cost savings associated with group sessions. The committee agreed that a
group session before the individual session could be an option. Despite the potential cost
savings, the committee did not want to be prescriptive about this because circumstances
can vary widely (for example, level of risk, level of distress or other factors such as
communication or language difficulties), which may mean that an individual session may
be preferable for some people.
Using a decision aid alongside genetic counselling showed benefits compared with
genetic counselling alone for some outcomes such as higher satisfaction with the support
received and better decision quality. Adding a decision aid was also associated with a
higher number of people taking up the option that was considered (which related to
ovarian cancer screening). However, the evidence was not clear about the components
used in the decision aid so the committee's recommendation reflected the uncertainty

[PAGE 46/68]

about whether a decision aid made up of different components would be equivalently
effective. The committee noted general principles related to decision aids in the NICE
guideline on shared decision making.
To emphasise the need for standard information about risk assessment and genetic
testing in genetics services and the content of this information, the committee highlighted
key information that should be given to people.
There was no evidence for any particular type of psychological intervention to support
decision making so the committee therefore made a recommendation for research on the
effectiveness of psychological interventions. However, the committee noted that making
decisions related to cancer risk can be stressful and can cause some people considerable
distress because it may impact their families' lives as well as their own, so psychological
support could be beneficial.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Genetic counselling is current practice. However, the broader eligibility criteria for genetic
testing may lead to an increased demand for these services, resulting in additional
pressure on existing genetics services. Some of this pressure may be reduced by people
choosing remote counselling or having group counselling sessions before individual
genetic counselling.
The provision of group counselling varies in practice and there may be some
implementation costs for services that do not already provide this. However, providing
group counselling would result in shorter individual counselling sessions, thereby helping
to alleviate some of the pressure on genetics services and potentially leading to cost
savings over time. Remote counselling may be more efficient and it may, for example,
enable more appointments to take place.
Patient decision aids (or aids that help the healthcare professional make decisions) are
already used in some services but there is variation in practice. The recommendation
would make decision aids more available in practice. Healthcare professionals already
provide a range of approaches to support decision making so adapting this to the relevant
decision context would not change current practice.
It is already current practice to refer someone who is distressed or has difficulties in
reaching a decision, for psychological support. The recommendation may potentially

increase referrals, but addressing such problems early on could result in significant
benefits to patients and cost savings to the NHS. For example, a lack of psychological
support may prevent engagement with care, or delay genetic testing or risk-reducing
surgery uptake.
The committee highlighted the limited availability of specialised psychological services in
some regions, specifically those designed to deal with psychological issues arising due to
genetic testing and risk management. They noted that all services should have referral
pathways to psychological services so that people in psychological distress can receive
the support they need. The committee also recognised that genetic counselling could help
address certain psychological concerns and that some people may need only
1 consultation with a psychologist, thus mitigating the potential impact on psychological
services.
Return to recommendations
Information and support in specialist services if a person has a
pathogenic variant or a strong family history of ovarian cancer
Recommendation 1.2.12 and table 3
Why the committee made the recommendation
The committee based the recommendation on qualitative evidence and evidence about
other specialist assessment or risk management services or strategies.
The evidence showed that people want information at the most appropriate time, as well
as several opportunities for discussions. An important time for this would be when the
person knows that they have a pathogenic variant or a strong family history of ovarian
cancer. The committee agreed the importance of providing sufficient information on an
ongoing basis. They recommended that in specialist services, people should receive
general as well as more specific information depending on their circumstances. There was
evidence that women are concerned about reproductive options and how having a
pathogenic variant affects this. The committee therefore also agreed that people should
have information about reproductive choices and risk-reduction options.
To emphasise the need for standard information in specialist services if a person has a
pathogenic variant and the content of this information, the committee highlighted key

information that should be given to people.
How the recommendation might affect practice
The committee agreed that it is current practice to provide information and support, but
noted that there is variation in when, what and how often it is provided. The
recommendation should lead to greater consistency. Although this may take up additional
time, it will allow people to better understand their risk and make informed choices. This
will improve people's satisfaction with services and may reduce their risk of developing
ovarian cancer and associated healthcare costs.
Return to recommendation
Assessing the risk of having a pathogenic variant
Recommendations 1.3.1 to 1.3.3
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee based the recommendations on evidence as well as their knowledge and
experience. The available evidence only focused on tools that identify people at risk of
carrying a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant.
The committee agreed that healthcare professionals need a set of simple criteria to know
when a person should be referred for genetic counselling and genetic testing. They agreed
that all people should be referred to genetics services who meet the criteria for genetic
testing to identify people at risk of having a pathogenic variant. They emphasised that this
would not only include people coming forward for testing but also family members of
people with a pathogenic variant who would be referred for cascade testing. People who
are unaffected by ovarian cancer but have a first- or second-degree relative with a
diagnosis of ovarian cancer may also have concerns about having a genetic risk, so can
also be referred. The committee clarified that this would apply to any first-degree relative
of someone with ovarian cancer. They clarified that for people with second-degree
relatives with ovarian cancer, this applies to the maternal and paternal sides, even if the
intervening relative is not affected (which would be in line with the thresholds in table 4).
Other criteria relate to people from at-risk populations and those with a diagnosis of
ovarian cancer (who may already be under the care of gynaecology oncology services
responsible for genetic counselling and genetic testing).

The committee noted that genetic tests are now commercially available (known as direct-
to-consumer testing), and discussed what would happen if a person accesses NHS
services and presents with a positive genetic test result. They agreed that not all direct-
to-consumer laboratories produce accurate test results or prepare people for their test
results. Therefore, positive test results for a pathogenic variant for which NHS testing is
offered will need to be discussed with an NHS genetics service to decide if referral is
needed. This is consistent with the joint guidance by the Royal College of GPs and the
British Society for Genetic Medicine.
There was evidence that there are a number of tools with good performance statistics
(sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve) to identify BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants.
The committee provided examples of tools (those with the largest evidence base) but did
not want to be too prescriptive because other tools had good accuracy (with less
evidence) and further calculation methods could be developed. The committee noted that
some clinical circumstances and the particular family history would impact the tool that is
used. They also discussed that sometimes people describe family histories which they
believe to be ovarian cancer even if it was another type of gynaecological cancer, and this
contributes to potentially inappropriate referral for genetic testing. They therefore
recommended that family histories should be verified (for example, via the Cancer Registry
or other medical documents).
Given the uncertainties about variants other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 and to address the
gap in the evidence, the committee also made a recommendation for research on optimal
tools to assess mutation carrier probability for a wider range of ovarian cancer
susceptibility genes, not limited to BRCA1 and BRCA2.
How the recommendations might affect practice and services
The committee noted that once criteria are met, it is current practice to arrange a referral
to genetics services. The criteria have changed (see the rationale and impact sections for
section 1.4) and therefore some of the referral criteria have changed in line with these. The
committee noted that referring people for genetic counselling and genetic testing if they
have a first-degree relative with ovarian cancer is current practice. However, referring
people with a second-degree relative who has ovarian cancer if they do not have an
affected intervening relative is not current practice (particularly on the maternal side), but
is in line with the thresholds in table 4. This change would be associated with a resource
impact, however, this will lead to more people being identified and taking up risk
management.

Direct-to-consumer testing is becoming more popular. The recommendation will
standardise practice and possibly reduce the burden on services having to manage
unreliable test results. The committee agreed that there are significant NHS costs in
confirming or refuting direct-to-consumer testing results and these are not warranted
unless there are clinical indications for testing. By liaising with NHS genetics services, it
can be ensured that only people at increased risk are referred. This is consistent with the
joint guidance by the Royal College of GPs and the British Society for Genetic Medicine
and should be current practice for most services.
Some tools are already being used but there is variation in practice. Where they are
currently not used, introducing them will not incur a substantial cost and will lead to better
identification and risk management.
Return to recommendations
Criteria for genetic testing
Family history of ovarian cancer
Recommendations 1.4.1 to 1.4.4 and table 4
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee based the thresholds for genetic testing on results from an economic
model that had been specifically conducted, which showed variation in the cost
effectiveness of panel genetic testing, where the thresholds differed according to gender
and age.
The committee discussed that cascade testing of family members of people with a
pathogenic variant is already current practice. This helps to identify people who also have
the same pathogenic variant so that risks can be managed to help prevent cancer. The
committee also noted that it is important to make recommendations for people in
situations where it is impossible or not clinically appropriate to test the relative who has
ovarian or breast cancer (or the tissue), or where people have a distant relative with a
known pathogenic variant but a closer relative cannot be tested.
The committee discussed genetic testing for people with a personal or family history

suggestive of a clinically defined syndrome associated with an increased risk of ovarian
cancer. They did not make any recommendations because people would be tested or
cascade tested if they or a family member had any of the syndromes specified in the
protocol. They also decided not to make a research recommendation for this topic
because these syndromes are very rare, so research would be unlikely or unfeasible.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Testing when a person has less than a 10% of having a pathogenic variant is not current
practice and the recommendations will make testing available to more people. This may
require service providers to make healthcare professionals and the public aware of this
change, and to make arrangements for implementation. This could also increase the
demand for support services such as psychological and menopause services. However,
this will lead to more people being identified and taking up risk management, and is a
cost-effective approach. Recommendations related to cascade testing are current
practice.
Return to recommendations
At-risk populations
Recommendation 1.4.5
Why the committee made the recommendation
The committee considered clinical as well as economic evidence. The clinical evidence
summarised the prevalence of pathogenic variants associated with ovarian cancer.
The evidence showed that the prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is higher in people from
Ashkenazi Jewish families (between 1.2% and 2.2%). The evidence also showed a higher
prevalence of BRCA1 in Greenlander people (between 1.1% and 11.64%).
Although the prevalence is lower in people from Sephardi Jewish populations compared
with Ashkenazi Jewish populations, there was economic evidence that testing of
Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish people is cost effective even if only 1 grandparent is from
the population. Based on this evidence, the committee used 'at least 1 grandparent' as the
definition for being from the specified population.

[PAGE 52/68]

The committee agreed that the economic evidence supports genetic counselling and
genetic testing for people from the at-risk populations specified, even if the family
background is the only criterion for genetic testing. However, they noted that this would
not be done through a centrally coordinated national screening programme, but that
awareness should be raised about the higher risk of having a founder pathogenic variant
so that people could come forward for testing. Healthcare professionals should then
recognise that the risk in these populations is higher and offer people referral to genetics
services.
How the recommendation might affect practice
The committee discussed that more people from at-risk populations may come forward for
genetic counselling and genetic testing, which will have resource implications. However,
they noted that this would not be full panel testing but only testing for the founder genetic
variant, which would be less costly.
The committee noted that the recommendation may initially be difficult to implement if
more people access genetics services, which are already overstretched. The committee
agreed that the impact will reduce after the first wave because numbers would become
naturally smaller. However, the recommendation could also increase the demand on
existing support services, including psychological and menopause services. Raising
awareness and increasing access to genetic counselling and genetic testing among at-risk
populations will, however, identify more people who will participate in risk management,
which is a cost-effective approach.
The committee noted that there is an NHS programme offering BRCA testing to those with
Jewish ancestry (the NHS Jewish BRCA testing programme) as well as a published
programme model (A collaborative genetic carrier screening model for the British
Ashkenazi Jewish community), and agreed that linking up with these projects may make
implementation easier because some of the pathways into the services would already be
established.

[PAGE 53/68]

Why the committee made the recommendation
The committee discussed the evidence that in people with ovarian cancer, the overall
prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants is around 17%. When grouped by
histological type of ovarian cancer, the highest prevalence of BRCA1 and BRCA2
pathogenic variants is around 22% in those with high-grade serous cancers. One study
reported a prevalence of around 18% for pathogenic variants of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C,
RAD51D or BRIP1. There was also economic evidence that testing for pathogenic variants
in people with ovarian cancer is cost effective. The committee agreed that this supports
testing people with ovarian cancer to establish whether they carry a pathogenic variant. If
a pathogenic variant is identified, it will help not only manage the person's ongoing care,
but will also mean that family members can be tested for the pathogenic variant. Based on
their expertise, the committee also recommended that people with other ovarian cancer
histotypes associated with pathogenic variants should also be tested.
How the recommendation might affect practice and services
According to current criteria, only people with non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer are
referred for genetic testing. However, the committee also noted that testing of mucinous
epithelial ovarian cancer is already common practice in many services. They further
discussed that mucinous ovarian cancer is associated with Lynch syndrome, which is
within the remit of this guideline and should therefore be included. However, in services
where people with mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer are not currently being tested, it
would represent a small change in practice due to the small number of people with
mucinous ovarian cancer. There may also be more people diagnosed with rarer non-
epithelial ovarian cancers accessing genetic counselling and genetic testing. However,
these cancers are very rare and this recommendation is not expected to result in
additional pressure on services.
Return to recommendation
Gene panel testing
Recommendations 1.5.1 and 1.5.2
Why the committee made the recommendations
Overall, the evidence showed that genes associated with an increased risk in ovarian

cancer were consistent with the genes recommended by the UK national genomic test
directory. Therefore, the committee agreed that BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,
RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1 and PALB2 should be the genes tested for in panel testing. They
noted that the national genomic test directory has different gene panels for different
conditions that may increase the risk of ovarian cancer, such as Lynch syndrome, or a
family history of breast as well as ovarian cancer. Because such panels would contain
different pathogenic variants to test for, the committee recommended which gene panel to
use in relation to each person's family or personal history.
How the recommendations might affect practice and services
The committee noted that it is already standard practice to use the gene panels
recommended by the UK national genomic test directory. However, the committee noted
that the criteria for a gene test are quite different to those in this guideline and that this
would lead to more people becoming eligible for gene testing. The committee agreed that
although this would have a cost impact, it would improve outcomes because more people
would be identified as having a pathogenic variant, and risk-reducing strategies as well as
cascade testing can be planned.
Return to recommendations
Assessing the risk of developing ovarian cancer
Recommendations 1.6.1 to 1.6.5
Why the committee made the recommendations
There was only evidence identified for 1 tool to assess the absolute risk of ovarian cancer
(CanRisk), so the committee used this evidence as well as their experience and
knowledge. They noted that the methods for assessing both probability of having a
pathogenic variant and the risk of developing ovarian cancer are related, and stressed the
need to take into account the recommendations in the section on assessing the risk of
having a pathogenic variant (because someone with a high risk of having a pathogenic
variant would therefore also have a higher likelihood of developing ovarian cancer).
The committee discussed the different services that may be involved in assessing
someone's risk of developing ovarian cancer. Once an increased risk is established (as

outlined in the section on criteria for genetic testing) and the person is under the care of
genetics services or a familial ovarian cancer multidisciplinary team, the service or team
should offer to assess their risk of developing ovarian cancer. If it has already been
established that the person has a pathogenic variant, the familial ovarian cancer
multidisciplinary team would be responsible for the assessment.
The committee agreed that the evidence showed a reasonable level of accuracy for the
CanRisk tool. It was also the only tool identified and they acknowledged that it would
provide some framework for an assessment, so decided to give this as an example of a
tool to use. They acknowledged that CanRisk is used to assess the risk of developing
breast and ovarian cancer, and that more specific tools to assess the risk of developing
ovarian cancer may be developed.
To use tools such as CanRisk, it is important to have as much information as possible.
However, with limited information, the person should be asked whether they know of any
other potential risk factors that may increase their risk of ovarian cancer. Based on their
experience, the committee discussed the factors that may not be accurately assessed by
tools, so highlighted some of these for clinicians to take into account when assessing risk.
The committee agreed that communicating risk and numerical data can be a challenge,
particularly in light of uncertainties around estimates. They also thought it would be helpful
to present this information in a variety of ways to make it more understandable. The
committee referred to the NICE guideline on shared decision making. They also referred to
the NICE guideline on familial breast cancer for risk factors that increase both breast and
ovarian cancer.
The committee also made a recommendation for research about tools or models to assess
the absolute risk of developing ovarian cancer, to encourage further tools to be
developed.
How the recommendations might affect practice and services
It is standard practice to assess a person's risk of developing ovarian cancer. However, the
way this is done varies, so the recommendations will improve efficiency and reduce
variation.

Primary preventive medicines
Recommendations 1.7.1 to 1.7.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
Aspirin
The evidence on aspirin did not show a protective effect in terms of ovarian cancer
incidence, so the committee did not recommend it for the sole purpose of reducing ovarian
cancer risk. However, they noted that there is existing NICE guidance on the use of aspirin
to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in people with Lynch syndrome. Because people
with Lynch syndrome are included in the scope of this guideline, the committee felt it was
important to link to the NICE guideline on colorectal cancer to ensure that they are aware
of this recommendation.
Combined oral contraceptives
The committee agreed, based on their knowledge and experience, that combined oral
contraceptives can be associated with a lower risk of ovarian cancer, but long-term use is
associated with an increase in breast cancer. They therefore decided to only recommend
oral contraceptives as a preventive medicine in particular circumstances: when the
reduction in ovarian cancer risk (based on for example age, family history) may outweigh
an increased breast cancer risk; and after taking into account whether the timing of risk-
reducing surgery is appropriate or not (for example, it may not be appropriate because of
age and planned pregnancy).
In the committee's experience, people are not always fully informed about the potential
risks (increased risk of developing breast cancer) and benefits (reduced risk of developing
ovarian cancer) of combined oral contraceptives, which is necessary for informed decision
making. They therefore recommended that this should be discussed so that people can
make an informed choice.
Given that evidence was only identified for 2 types of medicines, the committee decided
to make a recommendation for research about the effectiveness of primary preventive
medicines for reducing the incidence of ovarian cancer.

Risk-reducing surgery
Factors to take into account when considering risk-reducing
surgery
Recommendations 1.8.1 to 1.8.5
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee discussed general factors that need to be taken into account or discussed
with the person when considering risk-reducing surgery. Risk-reducing surgery means that
the person would become unable to become pregnant because their ovaries and fallopian
tubes would be removed. The committee agreed that risk-reducing surgery should not be
offered to people planning to conceive naturally because the incidence of ovarian cancer
in people younger than 35 is relatively small. Based on the evidence, they also specified
the criteria for offering risk-reducing surgery. The criteria relate to people who have a total
lifetime risk of ovarian cancer of 5% or over because they have either a pathogenic variant
or a strong family history. The committee noted that it is important to attempt to verify the
family history if possible (by exploring testing with the person or their family, or via the
Cancer Registry or other medical documents).
The committee discussed the importance of supporting people to make informed
decisions, and agreed the information and support that people should receive.
The committee agreed that decisions around risk-reducing surgery can cause anxiety and
stress. They discussed that the psychological impact of surgery should be taken into
account in discussions with the person, and that psychological support before surgery
may be needed.
The committee also discussed information and support to aid decision making, particularly
around menopause and managing symptoms for premenopausal people considering

bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
The committee noted, based on their knowledge and experience, that decisions about
risk-reducing surgery for people who are carriers of bi-allelic pathogenic variants in
mismatch repair genes (for example, homozygous PMS2) are complex. However, they are
also very rare so the committee agreed that a referral to a specialist multidisciplinary team
would be needed for discussions about potential risk-reducing surgery.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations will reinforce common good practice and will lead to safer practice
and better outcomes.
Return to recommendations
Types of risk-reducing surgery and timing in relation to the
person's specific pathogenic variant
Recommendations 1.8.6 to 1.8.11 and table 5
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee agreed that decisions related to risk-reducing surgery for ovarian cancer
should take into account the NICE guideline on familial breast cancer because some of the
genes associated with ovarian cancer would also increase the risk of breast cancer, so
considerations around risk-reducing mastectomy should be made in line with the NICE
familial breast cancer guideline.
The committee discussed the evidence that bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy improves
overall survival. They noted that most of the evidence came from studies with carriers of
the BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants. Based on the evidence, they recommended bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy for people at increased risk of ovarian cancer with BRCA1 and
BRCA2, and also RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1 or PALB2, which are also associated with an
increased risk of ovarian cancer.
The MLH1, MSH2 or MSH6 pathogenic variants are associated with Lynch syndrome,
which is associated with an increased risk of endometrial as well as ovarian cancer.
Although there was no evidence identified related to different types of surgery within this

[PAGE 59/68]

specific group, the committee decided that total hysterectomy as well as bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy should be recommended to prevent both of these types of
cancers. They noted that PMS2 is also associated with Lynch syndrome (and is therefore
on the associated gene panel). PMS2 increases the risk of endometrial cancer alone rather
than endometrial as well as ovarian cancer. They therefore did not add it to the table of
risk-reducing surgery for people at risk of ovarian cancer.
The committee made separate recommendations related to the PMS2 pathogenic variant
because of its link to Lynch syndrome. People with this pathogenic variant have an
increased risk of endometrial cancer alone, but could have an increased risk of ovarian
cancer if there is also a family history of ovarian cancer. They therefore considered it to be
safe to only recommend total hysterectomy for people with a heterogenous PMS2
pathogenic variant unless there is also a family history of ovarian cancer when additional
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy could be considered.
The committee used their knowledge and experience to agree the minimum ages for risk-
reducing surgery, and discussed that there could be exceptional circumstances when risk-
reducing surgery could be considered earlier, based on an individualised assessment.
The committee acknowledged that an argument could be made for having salpingectomy
first and then delayed oophorectomy, which would avoid a surgical menopause. They
noted that some of the evidence related to this showed promise. However, the evidence
had very short follow-up and therefore, the important outcomes such as overall survival
and ovarian cancer incidence could not be measured.
The committee noted that MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 increase the risk of endometrial
cancer, and therefore a hysterectomy is indicated only for carriers of these pathogenic
variants. The committee recommended against hysterectomy for carriers of other
pathogenic variants unless there would be other reasons for this to be done.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Risk-reducing surgery is already current practice, but the timing of when it is offered
varies. There is currently no specific consideration for the timing related to specific
pathogenic variants other than BRCA1 and BRCA2, and the committee noted that the
recommendations will standardise this. The recommended ages for risk-reducing surgery
correspond with increasing cancer incidence and offer the greatest potential for cancer
reduction and associated healthcare cost savings.

The committee noted that broader eligibility criteria for genetic testing will lead to more
people opting for risk-reducing surgery. This could put additional pressure on existing
services. However, risk-reducing surgeries are generally less complex and require less
extensive preoperative and postoperative care compared with ovarian cancer surgery. It
would also save costs associated with other cancer treatment as well as save lives.
Therefore, in the long term, risk-reducing surgery is likely to result in better outcomes for
people and cost savings for services.
Return to recommendations
Tests before risk-reducing surgery, referral to the gynaecology
oncology multidisciplinary team, and what to consider during
surgery
Recommendations 1.8.12 to 1.8.17
Why the committee made the recommendations
Tests before risk-reducing surgery
The committee used their knowledge and experience to agree the tests that should be
carried out before risk-reducing surgery to minimise the risk of missing asymptomatic
ovarian or endometrial cancer.
Referral to the gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team
There was evidence that risk-reducing surgery is effective and will identify asymptomatic
cancer in some people undergoing risk-reducing surgery. Based on this evidence, the
committee recommended that if this is identified before or after surgery, a referral should
be made to the gynaecology oncology multidisciplinary team so that cancer treatment can
be planned.
During risk-reducing surgery
Based on their knowledge and experience, the committee agreed that minimal access
surgery is generally preferred over a laparotomy. They noted that some of the evidence
included peritoneal washing, but the study included this in both arms of the comparison. It

[PAGE 61/68]

was therefore unclear whether this would be more effective than not using it. However, the
committee recommended that peritoneal washings should be taken to prevent missing
cancerous cells that may have spread to the peritoneal cavity. Missing cancerous cells,
such as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), would affect staging and ongoing
management. In their experience, the committee were aware that up to 5% of incidental
cancers could be missed if ultrasound alone is used, and that ultrasound is particularly
unreliable in Lynch syndrome. They therefore recommended that any lesions noticed
during surgery should be investigated – even if they are found outside the organs that are
being removed (such as in the peritoneal cavity) – to increase the likelihood of finding any
asymptomatic cancers.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The recommendations generally reflect current practice and will reduce variation. Taking
peritoneal washings is not currently practised everywhere but identifying cancer early,
correct staging and the appropriate treatment will lead to better outcomes.
Return to recommendations
Ovarian cancer surveillance by the familial ovarian cancer
multidisciplinary team for people who choose to delay or not
have risk-reducing surgery
Recommendations 1.8.18 to 1.8.20
Why the committee made the recommendations
The recommendations are based on limited evidence of the effectiveness of ovarian
cancer surveillance as well as how accurately the methods diagnose cancer. Not many
studies were identified, and the available studies were limited in the applicability of the
populations and the comparisons investigated.
The committee agreed that risk-reducing surgery is always superior to surveillance in
relation to preventing cancer and therefore decided not to recommend surveillance
because it could encourage people to delay or avoid risk-reducing surgery; the evidence
supported this. The committee also discussed the evidence that surveillance is associated
with an earlier detection of cancer but also noted a lack of data on an associated survival
benefit. However, the committee acknowledged that because people often have children

[PAGE 62/68]

later in life, they may delay or choose to not have risk-reducing surgery. The committee
discussed, based on their expertise and the evidence, that the risk of ovarian cancer rises
with age and incidence curves vary according to the pathogenic variant, and therefore
suggested varying ages for onset of surveillance if surgery was delayed or declined.
They were also concerned about the risk of false-positive surveillance results so
recommended the test with the best performance characteristics in relation to false-
positive and false-negative rates. If surveillance is carried out, the evidence showed that
serial 4-monthly CA125 longitudinal testing using an algorithm was the most accurate test
for this. In the evidence, this was based on the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA)
Test, but the committee did not want to rule out using other CA125 longitudinal testing
using another algorithm as long as it has demonstrated accuracy. The committee
acknowledged that an infrastructure needs to be in place, so recommended that all
surveillance activities should come under the remit of the familial ovarian cancer
multidisciplinary team who should coordinate, audit and interpret it, using a call and recall
mechanism. They recommended that there should be a review at least once a year to
discuss the recommendation of having risk-reducing surgery.
The committee agreed that people should be made aware that surveillance is not an
alternative to risk-reducing surgery and that risk-reducing surgery is the only way to
reduce their risk of developing ovarian cancer. It should also be explained that surveillance
would involve 4-monthly blood tests with an algorithm to analyse results and that there is
a possibility that a test result could be false. The committee decided that this information
is needed to encourage people not to delay the recommended risk-reducing surgery
indefinitely.
The committee also made a recommendation for research to obtain more evidence on the
long-term benefits and risks of ovarian cancer surveillance.
How the recommendations might affect practice
Because surveillance would be a change to current practice, the infrastructure for services
is not established. Implementing the recommendations may be a challenge and associated
with a considerable resource impact. Implementation would take up clinical as well as
administrative time, for example, screening invitations, appointments, cost of tests (the
ROCA Test is currently not available on the NHS), interpretation of tests and providing the
outcomes of tests. Surveillance has been shown to detect ovarian cancer at an earlier
stage but it has not been shown to translate into a survival benefit. The committee also

noted that most people would be expected to opt for risk-reducing surgery; hence, only
very few people would require surveillance, potentially mitigating some of the resource
impact.
Return to recommendations
Pathology protocol for handling specimens from
risk-reducing surgery
Recommendations 1.9.1 to 1.9.5
Why the committee made the recommendations
The committee agreed, based on their knowledge and experience, that people undergoing
risk-reducing surgery are at increased risk of having an occult precancerous or malignant
lesion, so intensive pathological investigation is needed. The committee discussed that
pathology protocols for the detection of microscopic lesions found within the fallopian
tubes have changed over time. The SEE-FIM (Sectioning and Extensively Examining the
FIMbriated End) protocol entails multiple sagittal sections of fimbriae combined with
2 mm-thick sections of the remainder. The committee agreed, based on their knowledge
and experience, that this type of sectioning is necessary to maximise the detection of
precancerous lesions and early cancers.
The committee discussed that immunohistochemistry is a relatively inexpensive, yet
informative, investigation that is available in all NHS pathology laboratories.
Immunohistochemistry (for p53 and Ki67/MIB1) helps in the identification of serous tubal
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) and high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. The committee
agreed that investigations of these markers are only necessary if a premalignant or
malignant lesion is suspected on morphological examination. They should not be
performed in morphologically normal fallopian tubes because immunohistochemistry
would not provide any additional information.
The committee agreed that to enable accurate reporting, surgical specimens need to be
correctly labelled. It is not possible to determine the laterality of an adnexa once it has
been removed from the body. Therefore, at the time of removal, surgeons should ensure
adnexal specimens are submitted in 2 separate containers and labelled as originating from
either the left or right adnexa. This will enable pathologists to issue accurate reports.

[PAGE 64/68]

The committee also agreed that peritoneal cytology is needed to correctly stage any
precancerous or cancerous lesions and detect occult peritoneal cancers.
The committee noted that people with Lynch syndrome are at increased risk of developing
endometrial cancers. In Lynch syndrome, there is a propensity for endometrial cancers to
arise within the lower uterine segment. The committee decided that the entire
endometrium, including the lower uterine segment, should be submitted for pathological
examination to ensure that such cancers and precancerous lesions are identified.
How the recommendations might affect practice
There is already widespread use of the SEE-FIM protocol by pathologists in dealing with
risk-reducing surgery specimens. Where this is not currently used, it will improve detection
of occult precancers and cancers and therefore may lead to earlier treatment. Therefore,
the recommendations will standardise the use of this pathology protocol.
Return to recommendations
Hormone replacement therapy after risk-reducing
surgery
Recommendations 1.10.1 to 1.10.4
Why the committee made the recommendations
There was little evidence about hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after risk-reducing
salpingo-oophorectomy. Studies were small and most had follow-up that was too short for
some of the outcomes investigated, such as cardiovascular events for which the baseline
risk is relatively low at a younger age. The committee noted that the evidence showed that
HRT is effective in decreasing vasomotor symptoms and agreed that this is in line with the
general literature on managing troublesome vasomotor symptoms. There was evidence
that HRT is associated with fewer diagnoses of osteoporosis as well as higher bone
mineral density. Despite the relatively small evidence base, this was consistent with the
committee's experience and knowledge. They recommended that HRT should be offered
to prevent loss of bone density and manage symptoms and, based on their knowledge and
experience, decided that it should be offered until the average age of menopause (which
is usually around 51 years).

The committee agreed that premenopausal women and people with female reproductive
organs without a history of breast cancer should be offered HRT after risk-reducing
surgery. They agreed that those with a history of certain types of breast cancer may
sometimes be prescribed HRT after risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but
that this should only be offered after advice from their breast cancer team. This is to
ensure that HRT would not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence given other
potential risk factors (for example, oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer).
The committee noted that oestrogen-only HRT is appropriate after a hysterectomy,
whereas only combined preparations are appropriate for those with a uterus. The
committee were also aware of a Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
(RCOG) Scientific impact paper on HRT after risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. To be
consistent with this paper, they agreed that in most cases, HRT could be started
immediately after surgery unless this is not clinically appropriate. They also decided, in line
with the RCOG recommendations, that it may be advisable to insert a levonorgestrel
intrauterine system at the same time as the surgery, if this was the preferred HRT option.
The committee discussed whether or not HRT should be continued after the person
reaches the average age of menopause. They agreed that although this is a possibility, it
should not automatically happen. If a person wants to take HRT beyond the average age of
menopause, there should first be a discussion to assess the person's individual risks and
benefits.
The committee were aware that genitourinary symptoms are effectively treated by vaginal
oestrogen for people who have not had breast cancer. This is consistent with the
conclusions from the NICE guideline on menopause.
Because of the sparsity of evidence, the committee made a recommendation for research
on the effectiveness and safety of HRT after risk-reducing surgery.
How the recommendations might affect practice
The committee noted that these recommendations align with other NICE guidance and
therefore should not change current practice.

Context
Familial ovarian cancer affects people born with female reproductive organs (ovaries,
fallopian tubes and/or a uterus). Although in this guideline, the term ovarian cancer is used
throughout, there is now evidence that most high-grade serous cancers (the most
common type of ovarian cancer) arise from the distal fallopian tube from a precursor lesion
referred to as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC).
In the UK, between 340,000 and 440,000 women have a pathogenic variant associated
with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. This includes pathogenic variants in BRCA1,
BRCA2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes. It is estimated
that 15% to 20% of those with high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer also carry a pathogenic
variant associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.
Most of the people who carry a pathogenic variant for ovarian cancer do not have a family
history suggestive of a genetic risk. This means many people have not sought testing for
high-risk ovarian cancer pathogenic variants. Current best estimates are that only 3% of
people with a pathogenic variant know that they are carriers. This proportion will increase
with improved availability of genetic testing.
Most women and people born with female reproductive organs who carry a pathogenic
variant will not develop ovarian cancer. This guideline recommends how to assess the risk
of having a pathogenic variant and the risk of developing ovarian cancer, what risk-
reducing interventions should or should not be offered, and what information and support
should be given.
The guideline does not cover risk management and decision-making support for people
born with male reproductive organs who have, or are at risk of having, a pathogenic
variant associated with ovarian cancer. This is because they are not at risk of developing
ovarian cancer, and the decisions that they would have to make are different and outside
the scope of this guideline.
