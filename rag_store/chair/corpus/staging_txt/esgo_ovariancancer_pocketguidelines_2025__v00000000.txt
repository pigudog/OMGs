The development of guidelines is one of the core activities of both the European
Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) and the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO), as part of their mission to improve the quality of care for pati-
ents with cancer across Europe. The European Society of Pathology (ESP) promotes
high-quality pathology diagnosis for all patients. Following the 2018 ESMO-ESGO
consensus conference (CC) on ovarian cancer, another CC took place on 15-16
June 2022 in Valencia, Spain. Pathology expertise was added by including ESP. Fo-
llowing the ESMO Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for CC, the aim was to
discuss new or contentious topics and develop recommendations to improve and
harmonise the management of patients with ovarian cancer.
The need for a CC was identified by the ESGO and ESMO Guidelines Committees.
A. Fagotti (ESGO), J. Ledermann (ESMO) and X. Matias-Guiu (ESP) were designated
as CC Chairs. The CC Chairs defined four broad topics and assigned 41 additional
experts from Europe with representation from Asia and the United States of Ameri-
ca to four working groups (WGs) based on their expertise, ensuring good represen-
tation across the three societies. An ESMO scientific advisor and a methodologist
(ESGO) were also included in the CC panel. Two WG Chairs for each WG were
nominated by the CC Chairs as follows:
1.	 Pathology and molecular biology (Chairs: B. Davidson and A. Leary);
2.	 Early-stage disease and pelvic mass in pregnancy (Chairs: F. Amant and C. Gourley);
3.	 Advanced stage (including older/frail patients) (Chairs: N. Concin and D. Lorusso);
4.	 Recurrent disease (Chairs: C. Fotopoulou and A. González-Martín).
Literature search was conducted by the ESGO methodologist using the Medline®
database to ensure that the recommendations were evidence-based. Prior the CC,
the WGs discussed published data and clinical experience and drafted recommen-
dations. Organisation of the pre-consensus process and onsite conference was ma-
naged by the ESMO Guidelines staff.
During the CC, the four WGs further discussed and agreed on the draft recommen-
dations in parallel sessions. These were presented to the entire panel before voting,
where they were discussed and modified as required. Forty individuals were eligible
to vote on recommendations (3 CC Chairs, 8 WG Chairs and 29 WG members). Four
WG members were unable to attend/vote in person but participated in post-CC vo-
ting. The ESGO methodologist and the ESMO scientific advisor did not participate in
the voting of recommendations. Voting was anonymous. Members could abstain from
voting if they perceived that they had insufficient expertise or a conflict of interest.

I
Evidence from at least one large randomised, controlled trial of good methodologi-
cal quality (low potential for bias) or meta-analyses of well conducted, randomised
trials without heterogeneity
II	 Small randomised trials or large randomised trials with a suspicion of bias (lower
methodological quality) or meta-analyses of such trials or of trials with demonstra-
ted heterogeneity
III	 Prospective cohort studies
IV	 Retrospective cohort studies or case-control studies
V	 Studies without control group, case reports, expert opinions
LEVELS OF EVIDENCE
A	 Strong evidence for efﬁcacy with a substantial clinical beneﬁt, strongly recommended
B	 Strong or moderate evidence for efﬁcacy but with a limited clinical beneﬁt, gene-
rally recommended
C	 Insufﬁcient evidence for efﬁcacy or beneﬁt does not outweigh the risk or the dis-
advantages (adverse events, costs…), optional
D	 Moderate evidence against efﬁcacy or for adverse outcome, generally not recom-
mended
E	 Strong evidence against efﬁcacy or for adverse outcome, never recommended
GRADES OF RECOMMENDATIONS
For recommendations that did not reach consensus onsite after two rounds of voting,
a post-CC exploration of disagreements was conducted using a modified Grading
of Recommendations, Assessment, Developmentand Evaluation (GRADE) methodo-
logy, described in the ESMO SOPs. The aim was to provide further insight into the
division of opinions to illustrate the extent to which consensus was/was not likely.
An adapted version of the ‘Infectious Diseases Society of America-United States Pu-
blic Health Service Grading System’ was used to define the level of evidence and
grade of recommendation for each recommendation proposed, based on the data
available up to the time of the CC:
These ESGO-ESMO-ESP CC recommendations are intended for use by all health pro-
fessionals involved in the management of patients with ovarian cancer across all
allied disciplines. They do not include any economic analysis of the strategies. Any
clinician seeking to apply or consult these CC recommendations is expected to use
independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances to
determine any patient’s care or treatment.

1. 	Which molecular and genomic tests should be carried out

at diagnosis as prognostic or predictive markers for high-grade
     tubo-ovarian carcinoma?
Pathology and molecular biology
An adequate surgical specimen or image-guided biopsy of treatment-naive
tumour is the preferred sample for diagnosis and molecular testing.
In all cases, the sample should contain a sufficient number of tumour cells
(preferably ≥30%). A cell block from peritoneal or pleural effusions may be
used for molecular analysis.
BRCA-mut (germline and/or somatic) testing is recommended at diagnosis
for patients with high-grade non-mucinous tubo-ovarian carcinoma regard-
less of stage.
Routine tumour testing for non-BRCA homologous recombination gene
mutations is not required; however, it should be encouraged in the research
setting.
Genomic instability tests are recommended in patients with BRCA wild-type
(wt) high-grade non-mucinous International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics stage III-IV tubo-ovarian carcinoma at diagnosis as this provides
useful predictive information for first-line maintenance therapy decisions.
A genomic instability test that has been clinically validated in large cohorts
or, preferably, phase III trials should be used.
There are no validated predictive markers of primary resistance to platinum
or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) at diagnosis and none
can be recommended at present.
General population screening for tubo-ovarian carcinoma cannot be recom-
mended because screening does not reduce cancer deaths.
CA-125 with or without HE4 should not be used alone to differentiate bet-
ween benign, borderline and malignant ovarian tumours.
A
B
2.	 What is the role of circulating and tissue biomarkers during

treatment and follow-up?
Routine monitoring of CA-125 after completion of first-line chemotherapy
is an option that should be discussed with the patient.
The CA-125 ELIMination rate constant K calculated using longitudinal CA-
125 over the first 100 days of treatment provides prognostic information,
and testing for this dynamic circulating marker can be considered.

Routine monitoring for circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and circulating
tumour cells is not recommended but should be encouraged within the
context of research projects.
Testing ctDNA for reversion mutations can be considered in patients with
BRCA-mutated tubo-ovarian carcinoma treated with at least one line of
platinum and eligible for PARPi treatment.
Chemotherapy response score at interval cytoreductive surgery on an
omental (preferred) or adnexal specimen provides prognostic information
and is recommended.
Testing for a reversion mutation in tumour samples at relapse can be consi-
dered in BRCA-mutated tumours.
A
C
3.	 How should low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) and high-grade

serous carcinoma (HGSC) be diagnosed?
LGSC and HGSC should be regarded as two distinct neoplasms with diffe-
rent morphology, underlying molecular events and behaviour and do not
represent different grades of the same tumour type.
The distinction between LGSC and HGSC is based on a combination of
morphology and p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC); in diagnostically chal-
lenging cases, referral for a specialist opinion and/or molecular testing is
recommended.
In cases with morphology suggestive of LGSC but aberrant p53 protein
expression and/or TP53 mutation, it is recommended that the tumour be
classified as HGSC.
In designating the primary site of extrauterine HGSC, the recommendations
of the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting should be followed.
Staining for Wilms tumour protein (WT-1) is recommended when the pri-
mary origin of HGSC (adnexal versus uterine) is unclear.
Results of p53 IHC should be reported as ‘wt or normal’ or ‘mutation-type
or aberrant’ rather than positive or negative.
As a minimum, paired box 8, oestrogen receptor, WT-1 and p53 IHC should
be carried out on diagnostic biopsies with a morphological suspicion of
LGSC or HGSC.
Testing for HER2 status in mucinous carcinoma can be considered to identi-
fy patients who may benefit from HER2-targeted strategies.
Testing for KRAS and BRAF mutational status in LGSC can be considered to
identify patients who may benefit from targeted strategies.

4.	 What is the role of molecular classification in ovarian endometrioid

carcinoma (EC) and clear-cell carcinoma (CCC)?
A TCGA-based molecular classification as used for endometrial carcinomas
can be considered to stratify ovarian EC.
Molecular markers are not recommended for prognostication in ovarian
CCC.
DNA mismatch repair IHC and/or microsatellite instability testing is recom-
mended in ovarian EC and CCC.
5.	 How should an adnexal mass be managed in pregnant women?
Early-stage disease and pelvic mass in pregnancy
It is recommended to evaluate all patients with suspicious adnexal masses
during pregnancy at a specialist referral centre.
Ultrasound by an expert is the recommended first-line imaging procedure
when an adnexal mass is diagnosed during pregnancy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as a second stage test
for the characterisation of indeterminate ovarian masses.
The routine use of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetopro-
tein is not recommended during pregnancy.
A proactive surgical approach depending upon gestational age is reco-
mmended in cases of high risk for malignancy during pregnancy.
Where needed, platinum-based chemotherapy at the same dosage as in
non-pregnant women is recommended as standard chemotherapy after the
first trimester of pregnancy.
Paclitaxel can also be administered to pregnant women.
Pregnant patients who receive chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma need
follow-up in high-risk obstetric units.
6.	 How should an adnexal mass be managed for women who want to

retain their fertility?
The option of fertility-sparing surgery should be discussed in young patients
with early-stage ovarian carcinoma.

Women with ovarian carcinoma who want to preserve their fertility need to
be managed in an oncofertility clinic.
Subjective assessment of the adnexal mass by an ultrasound expert is recom-
mended. If not available, the IOTA Assessment of Different NEoplasias in
the adneXa model (ADNEX) in combination with CA-125 is recommended
to differentiate between benign, borderline, early- or advanced-stage ova-
rian carcinoma and secondary carcinomas in young women who want to
preserve their fertility.
Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with surgical staging is recommended
in young patients with a malignancy apparently confined to the ovary and
who want to preserve their fertility.
Minimally invasive surgery avoiding tumour rupture is an acceptable approach
for women who wish to preserve their fertility.
It is not recommended to biopsy the unaffected ovary unless there is suspi-
cion of involvement.
In patients who wish to retain their fertility, cryopreservation of gametes
rather than ovarian tissue is recommended.
7.	 How should high-grade EC, CCC and high-risk mucinous stage I-II

tubo-ovarian carcinomas be managed?
Complete surgical resection including total abdominal hysterectomy, bilate-
ral-salpingo oophorectomy, omentectomy, systematic pelvic and para-aortic
lymph node dissection, peritoneal biopsies and cytological analysis should
be the standard surgical procedure in stage I-II high-grade EC, CCC and
high-risk mucinous ovarian carcinoma.
Patients with stage I-II high-grade EC should be offered adjuvant platinum-
-based chemotherapy.
Adjuvant chemotherapy may be omitted for adequately staged IA or IB
CCC.
Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for stage IC1 CCC.
Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for stages IC2, IC3 and II CCC.
Patients with high-risk stage I-II mucinous ovarian carcinoma should be
offered adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.

8.	 How should ovarian serous borderline tumours with peritoneal

implants be managed?
Since the pathological analysis of implants is complex, it is recommended
that the histological review of specimens is carried out by an expert patho-
logist.
It is recommended to manage women with stage II-III ovarian serous bor-
derline tumours at a specialist centre.
It is recommended to keep the distinction between invasive and non-inva-
sive implants for subsequent management.
It is recommended to surgically resect peritoneal and omental disease to
differentiate invasive from non-invasive implants.
9.	 How should early-stage LGSC with non-invasive peritoneal implants

be managed?
It is recommended to completely remove all peritoneal implants combined
with peritoneal staging as a standard treatment procedure.
Removal of enlarged or suspicious lymph nodes is recommended without
routine systematic lymphadenectomy.
Adjuvant chemotherapy could be considered for stage II LGSC.
Endocrine treatment following chemotherapy could be considered for
stage II LGSC.
10.	 How should incidental serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma

 (STIC) or microscopic HGSC be managed?
It is recommended that microscopic HGSC be managed as HGSC.
Sectioning and Extensively Examining the FIMbriated end (SEE-FIM) is recom-
mended in risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
SEE-FIM is recommended when there is doubt regarding the origin of the
carcinoma (endometrial, tubal, ovarian, peritoneal).
It is suggested that the pathologist examines microscopically the whole fim-
briae in benign conditions.
In STIC, staging of the peritoneum is recommended.

In STIC, it is recommended that (re)-staging is carried out, preferably by
a minimally invasive procedure.
In STIC, hysterectomy should be considered, particularly in patients with
a germline BRCA1 mutation (gBRCA1-mut).
In STIC, if the uterus is preserved, endometrial sampling in patients with
a gBRCA1-mut is recommended.
In STIC, lymphadenectomy is not recommended.
Adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended in surgically staged STIC.
In cases of STIC, testing for gBRCA1/2-muts and other high-penetrance
hereditary genes is mandatory.
11.	 How should patients with advanced tubo-ovarian carcinoma

be selected for primary cytoreductive surgery?
Advanced stage (including older/frail patients)
The selection of patients for primary cytoreductive surgery or neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NACT) must be carried out in an accredited ovarian cancer
centre (according to the ESGO quality indicators for ovarian cancer surgery
2016/2020) in a multidisciplinary setting.
Primary cytoreductive surgery is the preferred option and should be offered
if a complete resection seems achievable.
Primary cytoreductive surgery is the preferred option in patients with LGSC
if residual disease <1 cm can be achieved.
NACT with interval cytoreductive surgery is a valid alternative for patients
with a low likelihood of initial complete resection and with chemosensitive
histological types or for those who are poor surgical candidates due to
medical conditions.
Patients should be medically assessed for surgery, and this should be based
on clearly defined criteria requiring a thorough evaluation by a specialist
in gynaecological oncology. Medically unfit patients should additionally re-
ceive an internal medicine and/or anaesthesiology evaluation. Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group and American Society of Anesthesiology
scores must be documented.
Candidates for surgery based on a multidisciplinary team (MDT) report
should proceed to a laparotomy with the intent of complete cytoreduction.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography, MRI and positron emission
tomography-computed tomography with a structured radiology report are
considered as options for the initial evaluation of patients with advanced
ovarian carcinoma.
Ultrasound by an expert sonographer may be used to assess tumour extent
and resectability in the pelvis and abdominal cavity
Patients must be counselled for cytoreductive surgery by providing an
extensive discussion about the risk and benefits of the procedure specifi-
cally for that patient and outlining a comprehensive list of potential peri-
operative major and minor complications.
Patients for whom there is concern for incomplete cytoreductive surgery
based on a structured radiology report may undergo a laparoscopic evalua-
tion by a gynaecological oncologist to assess the extent of intra-abdominal
disease.
Scoring systems may play a role in guiding the evaluation and ultimately
triage patients for primary management. There is currently no universally
accepted scoring system that could be recommended.
Currently, there are no specific validated biomarkers that are predictive of
the success of surgical resection.
Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy should not be carried
out in patients with advanced disease who have undergone intra-abdo-
minal macroscopically complete resection and have non-suspicious lymph
nodes both on preoperative imaging and intraoperative clinical evaluation.
Enlarged or suspicious lymph nodes should be removed to achieve comple-
te resection.
The impact of resection of suspicious or enlarged extra-abdominal lymph
nodes remains unclear but should be considered if complete macroscopic
resection can be achieved intra-abdominally.
Resection of isolated parenchymal liver metastases should be considered to
achieve a complete cytoreduction.
12.	 What is the role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy

(HIPEC) in newly diagnosed tubo-ovarian carcinoma?
No consensus on the role of HIPEC and interval cytoreductive surgery was reached, which
reflects the current difference in opinion among the participants.

13.	 Which patients should receive bevacizumab, maintenance therapy

with PARPis or the combination of PARPis with bevacizumab

and for how long?
Molecular characteristics of tumour, patients and disease-related factors
should be considered in the decision-making process for maintenance
options.
The use of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy and as main-
tenance is recommended independently from any biomarker.
Bevacizumab should be administered in combination with platinum-pac-
litaxel chemotherapy and as maintenance for a maximum of 15 months.
Carcinosarcoma should be treated as HGSC.
LGSC should be treated with paclitaxel-carboplatin chemotherapy with or
without bevacizumab.
Chemotherapy followed by maintenance with endocrine therapy is an
option in stage III and IV tumours.
Patients with HGSC/high-grade EC and BRCA-muts or genomic instability
score (GIS)-positive (with a validated test) in complete response (CR)/partial
response (PR)/no evidence of disease (NED) after platinum-based chemo-
therapy with or without bevacizumab should receive PARPis with or without
bevacizumab.
Patients with HGSC/high-grade EC without a BRCA-mut and who are GIS-
-negative (with a validated test) may receive platinum-based chemotherapy
in combination with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance
or platinum-based chemotherapy followed by niraparib or rucaparib if in
CR/PR/NED. No maintenance treatment might be an option.
Patients with HGSC/high grade EC without a BRCA-mut and GIS unknown
could receive platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with bevacizu-
mab followed by bevacizumab maintenance or platinum-based chemothe-
rapy followed by niraparib or rucaparib if in CR/PR/NED.
When used as maintenance in patients in CR/PR/NED to platinum-based
chemotherapy, olaparib (alone or in combination with bevacizumab) and
rucaparib are recommended for 2 years, and niraparib is recommended for
3 years.

14.	 How should older/frail patients with tubo-ovarian carcinoma

be investigated and treated?
Patients should not be excluded from diagnostic procedures, clinical trials
and specific treatments for tubo-ovarian carcinoma based only on chrono-
logical age.
Vulnerability should be assessed in patients 70 years or any age with at
least two comorbidities, if possible, with the support of a geriatric specialist.
This assessment should focus on patient functions (activities of daily living/
instrumental activities of daily living), nutrition, psychological well-being,
comorbidities and concomitant medications and should not delay the start
of therapy.
Whenever possible, considering vulnerability, complexity of surgery and pa-
tient motivation, primary complete surgery is recommended.
NACT can be considered as an alternative in patients with vulnerability and
extensive disease.
The surgery should be carried out in expert centres involving scheduled
surgery, prehabilitation, intensive post-operative management, enhanced
recovery and home care.
The standard chemotherapy regimen is paclitaxel-carboplatin every 3 weeks.
The continuous weekly paclitaxel 60 mg/m²-carboplatin area under the cur-
ve (AUC) 2 schedule may provide better tolerability and quality of life (QoL)
and can be considered as an alternative option.
When indicated, PARPis and/or bevacizumab should be offered to older
patients carefully monitoring toxicity and concomitant medications.

15.	 What is the role of surgery in recurrent tubo-ovarian carcinoma?
Recurrent disease
Patients with tubo-ovarian carcinoma in first relapse >6 months since the
end of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy should be assessed for se-
condary cytoreductive surgery in a gynaecological oncology centre expe-
rienced in surgery for ovarian cancer.
Prospectively validated algorithms should be used as a guide to identify
optimal candidates for secondary cytoreductive surgery with complete
tumour resection.
NACT before cytoreductive surgery at relapse cannot be recommended
outside of clinical trials.
HIPEC is not recommended in cytoreductive surgery for relapsed disease.
Cytoreductive surgery could be offered to patients with subsequent relapses
in whom complete resection appears feasible.
In selected patients, palliative surgery to relieve mechanical obstruction may
be indicated after failure of conservative measures, either to remove the
tumour obstructing the bowel or to carry out a diversion procedure such as
a stoma. These patients should be managed within an MDT.
Palliative surgery should be offered only after careful consideration in pa-
tients with unfavourable conditions, such as rapidly progressing disease
without further systemic options, gastric outlet/upper gastrointestinal ob-
struction and multilevel sites of obstruction.
For oligometastatic recurrence, several treatment modalities such as surge-
ry, infield radiotherapy and thermal ablation should be considered within
an MDT.
The following factors should be considered to decide treatment modali-
ty for oligometastatic recurrence: site of recurrence, time to recurrence,
number of lesions, treatment-related morbidity, patient performance sta-
tus, type of maintenance treatments and patient preferences, regardless of
their BRCA status.
After local ablative/surgical tumour management, continuation of main-
tenance treatment with the same regimen could be considered.

16.	 What is the role of molecularly targeted therapy in recurrent disease?
For patients with BRCA-mutated tumours, eligible for platinum and no prior
PARPis and no prior bevacizumab use, a platinum-based combination fo-
llowed by PARPis is recommended after CR/PR/NED. Bevacizumab may still
be considered depending on patient’s symptoms and response to chemo-
therapy.
For patients with BRCA-wt or unknown tumours eligible for platinum and
no prior PARPis and no prior bevacizumab, maintenance therapy is recom-
mended with PARPis (after CR/PR/NED) or bevacizumab. Bevacizumab
added to chemotherapy followed by maintenance should be prioritised for
patients in need of rapid symptom control.
For patients eligible for platinum and no prior PARPis but prior bevacizu-
mab, platinum-based chemotherapy followed by PARPi maintenance is
preferred as long as CR/PR/NED is achieved, regardless of their BRCA and
HRD status.
For patients eligible for platinum and prior PARPis but no prior bevacizu-
mab, a platinum-based combination with bevacizumab followed by main-
tenance should be recommended. The preferred chemotherapy partner for
bevacizumab in the recurrent setting is carboplatin-pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin (PLD).
For patients eligible for platinum and prior use of bevacizumab and PARPis,
a platinum-based chemotherapy should still be recommended and rechal-
lenge options of maintenance agents could be considered.
Monitoring of safety should be carried out according to drug-specific recom-
mendations, with special focus on late safety issues.
Routine oncological follow-up is recommended including imaging and/or
CA-125 according to local practice and after discussion with the patient.
In the recurrent setting, the duration of PARPis as maintenance should be
until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
Bevacizumab rechallenge in combination with platinum should be conside-
red in patients already pre-treated with bevacizumab in the first line.
The preferred chemotherapy partner for bevacizumab (rechallenge) in the
recurrent setting is carboplatin-PLD.
Patients in response to platinum-based chemotherapy after prior PARPi
maintenance therapy may be considered for a PARPi-maintenance rechal-
lenge given a duration of prior PARPi exposure of 18 months in the first
line and 12 months in further lines or 12 months and 6 months for patients
with a BRCA-mut or BRCA-wt status, respectively.

17.	 What is the role of non-platinum drugs and supportive care options?
For patients progressing on platinum-based therapy or after a short treat-
ment-free interval or for those who are intolerant of platinum and not
eligible for platinum rechallenge, various management options should be
considered, ranging from non-platinum single-agent systemic therapy to
supportive care alone.
Patients should be included in clinical trials, when possible, as there is
a significant need for improved treatment options in this setting.
For patients who have not received prior bevacizumab, the addition of this
agent to weekly paclitaxel, PLD or topotecan should be considered. The
combination of weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab is the preferred option
based on trial subset analysis.
The combination of trabectedin and PLD could be considered in those pati-
ents who are intolerant to platinum who have relapsed after 6 months from
the last platinum dose.
Patients with LGSC relapse should be considered for treatment with trame-
tinib after platinum failure or for endocrine therapy.
Supportive care alone should be considered when expected benefit of che-
motherapy is limited.
Systematic assessment of QoL and symptoms during treatment is recom-
mended to start early supportive care and prevent or improve symptoms,
QoL and survival.
18.	 What is recommended regarding evaluation of QoL/survivorship

issues and follow-up after treatment?
QoL and symptom assessment via validated tools could be considered as
part of the routine follow-up in all patients with ovarian carcinoma.
Long-term follow-up is recommended for all patients with tubo-ovarian
carcinoma by a physician experienced in the treatment and follow-up of
patients with gynaecological cancer.
