The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the
European Society of Pathology held a consensus conference (CC) on ovarian cancer on 15-16 June 2022 in Valencia,
Spain. The CC panel included 44 experts in the management of ovarian cancer and pathology, an ESMO scientiﬁc
advisor and a methodologist. The aim was to discuss new or contentious topics and develop recommendations to
improve and harmonise the management of patients with ovarian cancer. Eighteen questions were identiﬁed for
discussion under four main topics: (i) pathology and molecular biology, (ii) early-stage disease and pelvic mass in
pregnancy, (iii) advanced stage (including older/frail patients) and (iv) recurrent disease. The panel was divided into
four working groups (WGs) to each address questions relating to one of the four topics outlined above, based on
their expertise. Relevant scientiﬁc literature was reviewed in advance. Recommendations were developed by the
WGs and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This manuscript
focuses on the recommendation statements that reached a consensus, their voting results and a summary of
evidence supporting each recommendation.
Key words: chemotherapy, maintenance treatment, molecular biology, ovarian cancer, pathology, surgery
INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer is the second-highest cause of death among
all gynaecological cancers.1 The estimated number of new
cases in Europe in 2020 was 66 693 with 44 053 deaths.2
More than two-thirds of patients are diagnosed at an
advanced stage. Ovarian cancer diagnosed in young women
raises concerns about their fertility. When diagnosed during
pregnancy,
maternal
and
fetal
factors
need
to
be
considered.
More than 90% of malignant ovarian tumours are
designated tubo-ovarian carcinoma (also referred to as
epithelial ovarian cancer). The most common and most le-
thal tubo-ovarian carcinoma is high-grade serous carcinoma
(HGSC).3 Less frequent epithelial subtypes with distinct
morphological and molecular characteristics include high-
grade endometrioid carcinoma (EC), low-grade serous car-
cinoma (LGSC) and clear-cell carcinoma (CCC).
The development of guideline recommendations is one
of the core activities of both the European Society of
Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) and the European Society
for Medical Oncology (ESMO), as part of their mission to
improve the quality of care for patients with cancer across
Europe. The European Society of Pathology (ESP) promotes
high-quality pathology diagnosis for all patients. Following
the 2018 ESMOeESGO consensus conference (CC) on
ovarian cancer,4 another CC took place on 15-16 June 2022
in Valencia, Spain, to discuss new or contentious topics.
Pathology expertise was added by including ESP. The aim
was to improve and harmonise the management of patients
with ovarian cancer. Published evidence was evaluated
incorporating clinical experience to arrive at consensus
recommendations
through
an
anonymous
voting
procedure.
This manuscript focuses on the recommendation state-
ments that reached a consensus and their voting results.
The summary of evidence supporting each recommendation
is available in the Supplementary Material, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2023.11.015. For topics
not covered in this article, please refer to the 2018
ESMOeESGO CC recommendations on ovarian cancer,4 the
ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for diagnosis,
treatment and follow-up of patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer5 and non-epithelial ovarian cancer6 and the ESGO/
International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gy-
necology (ISUOG)/International Ovarian Tumor Analysis
(IOTA)/European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy
(ESGE) consensus statement on preoperative diagnosis of
ovarian tumours.7
METHODOLOGY
The CC followed the ESMO Standard Operating Procedures
(SOPs) for CCs, available here: https://www.esmo.org/
guidelines/esmo-guidelines-methodology.
Collection
and
review of author declarations of interest (DOIs) followed
the ESMO DOI policy, available here: https://www.esmo.
org/about-esmo/how-we-work/declaration-of-interest.
The need for a CC was identiﬁed by the ESGO and ESMO
Guidelines Committees. Anna Fagotti (ESGO), Jonathan
Ledermann (ESMO) and Xavier Matias-Guiu (ESP) were
designated as CC Chairs. The CC Chairs deﬁned four broad
topics and assigned 41 additional experts from Europe with
representation from Asia and the USA to four working
groups (WGs) based on their expertise, ensuring good
representation across the three societies. Two WG Chairs
for each WG were nominated by the CC Chairs as follows
(see Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/
10.1016/j.annonc.2023.11.015, for all participants):
1. Pathology and molecular biology (Chairs: B. Davidson
and A. Leary)
2. Early-stage disease and pelvic mass in pregnancy
(Chairs: F. Amant and C. Gourley)
3. Advanced stage (including older/frail patients) (Chairs:
N. Concin and D. Lorusso)
4. Recurrent disease (Chairs: C. Fotopoulou and A. Gonzá-
lez-Martin)
Literature searches were conducted by a methodologist
(F. Planchamp) using the Medline® database to ensure that

the recommendations were evidence-based. The search
terms for each WG topic are provided in Supplementary
Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.
2023.11.015. The reference list of each identiﬁed article
was reviewed for other potentially relevant papers. WG
members were allowed to consider other publications not
identiﬁed in the literature search.
The WGs discussed published data and clinical experience
and drafted recommendation statements. These were
reviewed by the CC Chairs.
During the CC, 40 individuals were eligible to vote on
recommendation statements (3 CC Chairs, 8 WG Chairs and 29
WGmembers).FourWGmemberswereunabletoattend/vote
in person but participated in post-CC voting and authorship of
the ﬁnal manuscript. F. Planchamp and C. Sessa (ESMO sci-
entiﬁc advisor) did not participate in the voting of consensus
recommendations but authored the ﬁnal manuscript.
In parallel sessions, the four WGs further discussed and
agreed on the draft statements. These were presented to
the entire panel before voting, where they were discussed
and modiﬁed as required. An adapted version of the ‘In-
fectious Diseases Society of America-United States Public
Health Service Grading System’8 was used to deﬁne the
level of evidence (LoE) and grade of recommendation (GoR)
for each recommendation proposed, based on the data
available up to the time of the CC (i.e. as of 14 June 2022)
(see Supplementary Table S3, available at https://doi.org/
10.1016/j.annonc.2023.11.015).
Voting was anonymous. Members could abstain from
voting if they perceived that they had insufﬁcient expertise
or a conﬂict of interest. Results of 75% agreement and
20% disagreement were considered a consensus. Results
of <75% agreement or >20% disagreement were not
considered a consensus.
Recommendation statements that reached a consensus are
detailed in the manuscript. The statements that did not reach
consensus are reported in the Supplementary Material, avail-
able at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2023.11.015. For
recommendation statements that did not reach consensus
onsite after two rounds of voting, a post-CC exploration of
disagreements was conducted using a modiﬁed Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) methodology, described in the ESMO SOPs.9,10 The
aim was to provide further insight into the division of opinions
to illustrate the extent to which consensus was/was not likely.
All LoEs and GoRs were reviewed post-CC by F. Planchamp
to verify that they could be fully supported by available
evidence. If an LoE could not be conﬁrmed by existing evi-
dence, an alternative LoE was proposed. Similarly, if any in-
consistencies were found between the strength of evidence
and the assigned GoR, an alternative GoR was proposed.
All authors were asked to vote again anonymously online
on recommendation statements with updated LoEs and/or
GoRs. The voting results for these revised statements were
considered as ﬁnal and are included in the manuscript. All
participants approved the ﬁnal manuscript.

See Supplementary Material Section 1, available at https://
doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2023.11.015, for detailed sup-
porting evidence for these recommendations.
1. Which molecular and genomic tests should be carried
out at diagnosis as prognostic or predictive markers
for high-grade tubo-ovarian carcinoma?
Adequate tissue or a cell block from a cytology specimen
is needed for molecular testing, which can identify mutations
and/or inform treatment decisions [e.g. poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) when BRCA1/2 pathogenic
variant mutations (BRCA1/2-muts) are present]. Adequate
DNA is required for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Germline
BRCA1/2 mutations (gBRCA1/2-muts), conﬁrmed on testing
normal cellular material, are present in 13%-15% of HGSCs
and somatic BRCA1/2-muts in 5%-7% of tumours.11 Genomic
instability tests should be carried out in newly diagnosed
high-grade non-mucinous tubo-ovarian carcinoma. These
tests identify functional disturbance in homologous recom-
bination repair of DNA damage that can be present due to
BRCA mutations and other factors, such as mutations in
homologous recombination repair genes.12-14 Cancer antigen
125 (CA-125) and human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) are two
serological markers used to assist in the diagnosis of tubo-
ovarian carcinoma.15
Recommendation 1.1: An adequate surgical specimen or
image-guided biopsy of treatment-naive tumour is the
preferred sample for diagnosis and molecular testing [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (41) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (41
voters)
Recommendation 1.2: In all cases, the sample should
contain a sufﬁcient number of tumour cells (preferably
30%). A cell block from peritoneal or pleural effusions
may be used for molecular analysis [IV, B].
Consensus: 97.6% (40) yes, 2.4% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 1.3: BRCA-mut (germline and/or so-
matic) testing is recommended at diagnosis for patients
with high-grade non-mucinous tubo-ovarian carcinoma
regardless of stage [I, A].
Consensus: 98% (39) yes, 3% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 1.4: Routine tumour testing for non-
BRCA homologous recombination gene mutations is not
required; however, it should be encouraged in the research
setting [IV, B].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 1.5: Genomic instability tests are rec-
ommended in patients with BRCA wild-type (wt) high-grade

non-mucinousa International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III-IV tubo-ovarian carcinoma at
diagnosis as this provides useful predictive information for
ﬁrst-line maintenance therapy decisions [I, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 1.6: A genomic instability test that has
been clinically validated in large cohorts [III, B] or, prefer-
ably, phase III trials should be used [I, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 1.7: There are no validated predictive
markers of primary resistance to platinum or PARPis at
diagnosis and none can be recommended at present [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 1.8: General population screening for
tubo-ovarian carcinoma cannot be recommended because
screening does not reduce cancer deaths [I, E].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 1.9: CA-125 with or without HE4
should not be used alone to differentiate between benign,
borderline and malignant ovarian tumours [IV, D].
Consensus: 97.6% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 2.4% (1) abstain
(41 voters)
2. What is the role of circulating and tissue biomarkers
during treatment and follow-up?
CA-125 is frequently used to monitor the response to
chemotherapy (ChT), but there is less certainty about its use
for follow-up. In the neoadjuvant setting, modelled CA-125
ELIMination rate constant K (KELIM) predicts the likelihood
of complete interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS) and the risk
of subsequent platinum-resistant relapse.16-18 Histopatho-
logical examination of omental specimens is used to
determine the ChT response score (CRS) and is a repro-
ducible prognostic tool to assess the response to neo-
adjuvant ChT (NACT).19-22 Reversion BRCA-muts in tumour
or in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) are markers for
resistance to PARPis.23 Further investigation is needed to
evaluate the utility of ctDNA outside of research.
Recommendation 2.1: Routine monitoring of CA-125
after completion of ﬁrst-line ChT is an option that should
be discussed with the patient [IV, A].
Consensus: 88% (35) yes, 8% (3) no, 5% (2) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 2.2: The CA-125 KELIM calculated us-
ing longitudinal CA-125 over the ﬁrst 100 days of treatment
provides prognostic information, and testing for this dy-
namic circulating marker can be considered [III, B].
Consensus: 78% (31) yes, 13% (5) no, 10% (4) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 2.3: Routine monitoring for ctDNA and
circulating tumour cells is not recommended but should be
encouraged within the context of research projects [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 2.4: Testing ctDNA for reversion mu-
tations can be considered in patients with BRCA-mutated
tubo-ovarian carcinoma treated with at least one line of
platinum and eligible for PARPi treatment [III, C].
Consensus: 95% (38) yes, 0% (0) no, 5% (2) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 2.5: CRS at ICS on an omental
(preferred) or adnexal specimen provides prognostic infor-
mation and is recommended [III, B].
Consensus: 75% (30) yes, 20% (8) no, 5% (2) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 2.6: Testing for a reversion mutation in
tumour samples at relapse can be considered in BRCA-
mutated tumours [III, C].
Consensus: 93% (37) yes, 5% (2) no, 3% (1) abstain (40
voters)
3. How should LGSC and HGSC be diagnosed?
Most LGSCs arise in the ovary24 and develop from
benign serous tumours and serous borderline tumours
(SBTs), while most HGSCs develop from serous tubal
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) at the ﬁmbrial end of the
fallopian tube.
The distinction between LGSC and HGSC is based on a
combination of morphology and p53 immunohistochem-
istry (IHC). Mutations in KRAS or BRAF are common in LGSC
and TP53 mutations are ubiquitous in HGSC.
Recommendation 3.1: LGSC and HGSC should be
regarded
as
two
distinct
neoplasms
with
different
morphology, underlying molecular events and behaviour
and do not represent different grades of the same tumour
type [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.2: The distinction between LGSC and
HGSC is based on a combination of morphology and p53 IHC;
in diagnostically challenging cases, referral for a specialist
opinion and/or molecular testing is recommended [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.3: In cases with morphology sug-
gestive of LGSC but aberrant p53 protein expression and/or
TP53 mutation, it is recommended that the tumour be
classiﬁed as HGSC [IV, A].
Consensus: 93% (37) yes, 0% (0) no, 8% (3) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.4: In designating the primary site of
extrauterine HGSC, the recommendations of the Interna-
a(HGSC and EC)

tional Collaboration on Cancer Reporting should be fol-
lowed [III, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.5: Staining for Wilms tumour protein
(WT-1) is recommended when the primary origin of HGSC
(adnexal versus uterine) is unclear [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.6: Results of p53 IHC should be re-
ported as ‘wt or normal’ or ‘mutation-type or aberrant’
rather than positive or negative [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.7: As a minimum, paired box 8, es-
trogen receptor, WT-1 and p53 IHC should be carried out on
diagnostic biopsies with a morphological suspicion of LGSC
or HGSC [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation
3.8:
Testing
for
HER2
status
in
mucinous carcinoma can be considered to identify patients
who may beneﬁt from HER2-targeted strategies [IV, C].
Consensus: 95% (38) yes, 3% (1) no, 3% (1) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 3.9: Testing for KRAS and BRAF
mutational status in LGSC can be considered to identify
patients who may beneﬁt from targeted strategies [IV, C].
Consensus: 95% (38) yes, 5% (2) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
4. What is the role of molecular classiﬁcation in ovarian
EC and CCC?
EC and CCC are endometriosis-associated neoplasms25
and the endometriosis can be completely overgrown.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-based molecular clas-
siﬁcation used for endometrial carcinomas has been applied
to ovarian EC, as it is prognostically useful. Data regarding
the role of the TCGA classiﬁcation in ovarian CCC are less
robust. DNA mismatch repair (MMR) IHC and/or microsat-
ellite instability (MSI) testing is recommended in all cases to
help
identify
Lynch-syndrome-related
ovarian
EC
and
CCC.26-28
Recommendation 4.1: A TCGA-based molecular classiﬁ-
cation as used for endometrial carcinomas can be consid-
ered to stratify ovarian EC [IV, B].
Consensus: 95% (38) yes, 5% (2) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Recommendation 4.2: Molecular markers are not rec-
ommended for prognostication in ovarian CCC [IV, D].
Consensus: 90.2% (37) yes, 0% (0) no, 9.8% (4) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 4.3: DNA MMR IHC and/or MSI testing
is recommended in ovarian EC and CCC [II, A].
Consensus: 100% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (40
voters)
Early-stage disease and pelvic mass in pregnancy
See Supplementary Material Section 2, available at https://
doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2023.11.015, for detailed sup-
porting evidence for these recommendations.
5. How should an adnexal mass be managed in pregnant
women?
Ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
are ﬁrst-line imaging modalities for detailed locoregional
disease assessment (depending on availability of expertise).
The role of serum tumour markers is still unclear.
Most functional cysts undergo spontaneous resolution
before 16 weeks of gestation and expectant management is
reasonable. Surgery can be carried out safely during preg-
nancy, preferably within 22 weeks of gestation.29 If
advanced-stage tubo-ovarian carcinoma is diagnosed during
the ﬁrst half of pregnancy, termination should be consid-
ered. In patients wishing to preserve their pregnancy,
platinum-based
ChT
including
paclitaxel
can
be
considered.29
Prenatal exposure to maternal ChT does not impair organ
function or child development.30,31
Recommendation 5.1: It is recommended to evaluate all
patients with suspicious adnexal masses during pregnancy
at a specialist referral centre [V, A].
Consensus: 95.1% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 4.9% (2) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 5.2: US by an expert is the recom-
mended ﬁrst-line imaging procedure when an adnexal mass
is diagnosed during pregnancy [III, A].
Consensus: 95.1% (39) yes, 2.4% (1) no, 2.4% (1) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 5.3: MRI is recommended as a second-

6. How should an adnexal mass be managed for women
who want to retain their fertility?
Fertility-sparing surgery appears safe in patients with
borderline tumours, non-epithelial tumours, low-grade
stage IA (serous, endometrioid or mucinous expansile sub-
type) and selected IC1 stages.32
Oncofertility clinics are best positioned to provide a
model of care for patients eligible for fertility preservation
using a checklist for a high-quality fertility-preservation
programme.33
Recommendation 6.1: The option of fertility-sparing
surgery should be discussed in young patients with early-
stage ovarian carcinoma [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 6.2: Women with ovarian carcinoma
who want to preserve their fertility need to be managed in
an oncofertility clinic [V, A].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 3% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 6.3: Subjective assessment of the
adnexal mass by a US expert is recommended. If not
available, the IOTA Assessment of Different NEoplasias in
the adneXa model (ADNEX) in combination with CA-125 is
recommended to differentiate between benign, borderline,
early- or advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma and secondary
carcinomas in young women who want to preserve their
fertility [III, A].
Consensus: 90% (35) yes, 8% (3) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 6.4: Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
with surgical staging is recommended in young patients
with a malignancy apparently conﬁned to the ovary and
who want to preserve their fertility [III, A].
Consensus: 95% (37) yes, 3% (1) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 6.5: Minimally invasive surgery avoid-
ing tumour rupture is an acceptable approach for women
who wish to preserve their fertility [IV, A].

the unaffected ovary unless there is suspicion of involve-
ment [V, E].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (39

Recommendation 6.7: In patients who wish to retain
their fertility, cryopreservation of gametes rather than
ovarian tissue is recommended [V, A].

7. How should high-grade EC, CCC and high-risk mucinous
stage I-II tubo-ovarian carcinomas be managed?
In these histological subtypes, the debate relates to
lymph node resection. Data are retrospective; in general,
the risk of lymph node metastases is 20% in stage I and 40%
in stage II34 but can vary according to grade and histology in
different series (17.4% for early-stage, high-grade EC, 7%-
12% in early-stage CCC and 30% in inﬁltrative mucinous
ovarian cancer).35-37
Randomised trials in patients with stage I-II tubo-ovarian
carcinoma demonstrated that adjuvant platinum-based ChT
prolonged survival, but did not prospectively evaluate his-
tological subtypes.38,39 High-grade EC has a similar prog-
nosis to HGSC and is worse than low-grade EC. It is not clear
whether there is any survival beneﬁt for adjuvant ChT in
stage IA or IB CCC.40,41
Recommendation
7.1:
Complete
surgical
resection
including total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy, omentectomy, systematic pelvic and para-
aortic lymph node dissection, peritoneal biopsies and
cytological analysis should be the standard surgical pro-
cedure in stage I-II high-grade EC, CCC and high-risk
mucinous ovarian carcinoma [IV, A].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 3% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 7.2: Patients with stage I-II high-grade
EC should be offered adjuvant platinum-based ChT [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 7.3: Adjuvant ChT may be omitted for
adequately staged IA or IB CCC [IV, C].
Consensus: 90% (35) yes, 5% (2) no, 5% (2) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 7.4: Adjuvant ChT may be considered
for stage IC1 CCC [IV, C].
Consensus: 92% (36) yes, 8% (3) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 7.5: Adjuvant ChT is recommended for
stages IC2, IC3 and II CCC [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 7.6: Patients with high-risk stage I-II
mucinous ovarian carcinoma should be offered adjuvant
platinum-based ChT [IV, A].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
8. How should ovarian SBTs with peritoneal implants be
managed?
Ovarian SBT is deﬁned as a non-invasive, low-grade,
proliferative serous epithelial neoplasm.42 In 14%-30% of
SBTs, extraovarian peritoneal implants are present.43-46 The

between non-invasive and invasive implants. Invasive im-
plants are deﬁned as “in most cases the epithelial compo-
nent
predominates,
especially
with
a
micropapillary/
cribriform pattern associated with retraction artefact, and
there is destructive invasion of underlying structures or
obliteration of normal omental architecture by invasive
tumour”.42 The prognosis is worse in patients with invasive
implants.44,45
Recommendation 8.1: Since the pathological analysis of
implants is complex, it is recommended that the histological
review of specimens is carried out by an expert pathologist
[V, A].
Consensus: 100% (41) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (41
voters)
Recommendation 8.2: It is recommended to manage
women with stage II-III ovarian SBTs at a specialist centre
[V, A].
Consensus: 95.1% (39) yes, 2.4% (1) no, 2.4% (1) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 8.3: It is recommended to keep the
distinction between invasive and non-invasive implants for
subsequent management [IV, A].
Consensus: 92% (36) yes, 5% (2) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 8.4: It is recommended to surgically
resect peritoneal and omental disease to differentiate
invasive from non-invasive implants [V, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
9. How should early-stage LGSC with non-invasive perito-
neal implants be managed?
Randomised data on ChT or hormone treatment are
absent, but LGSC is far less chemosensitive than HGSC
(although most reports are from the relapsed setting).47-50
In a meta-analysis of retrospective studies investigating
apparent early-stage, low-grade tubo-ovarian carcinoma,
the incidence of occult lymph node metastases was 2.9%.51
Recommendation 9.1: It is recommended to completely
remove all peritoneal implants combined with peritoneal
staging as a standard treatment procedure [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 9.2: Removal of enlarged or suspicious
lymph nodes is recommended without routine systematic
lymphadenectomy [IV, A].
Consensus: 85% (33) yes, 15% (6) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 9.3: Adjuvant ChT could be considered
for stage II LGSC [IV, C].
Consensus: 92% (36) yes, 5% (2) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 9.4: Endocrine treatment following
ChT could be considered for stage II LGSC [V, C].
Consensus: 90% (35) yes, 8% (3) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
10. How should incidental STIC or microscopic HGSC be
managed?
The frequency of STIC detected in risk-reducing bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomies (RRBSOs) in high-risk populations
(patients with a BRCA-muts) is quite variable (0.4%-8.5%)
but w10-fold higher than in low-risk populations.52-55 There
is no precise deﬁnition for ‘microinvasive’ tubal HGSC, but
STICs associated with ‘microscopic’ invasive HGSC may be
the source of peritoneal HGSC and, therefore, should be
managed as HGSC.56
The accurate sampling of the tuba by Sectioning and
Extensively Examining the FIMbriated end (SEE-FIM) proto-
coldrecommended both in women with a BRCA-mut and
those with an unknown genetic predispositiondand the
improved diagnostic criteria, including the use of p53 and ki-67
immunostainings, has identiﬁed occult lesions, which were
previously missed in classical grossing procedures, as STIC.57-59
There is an increased risk of peritoneal carcinoma
developing with follow-up after RRBSO if a STIC is present,
which supports staging of the peritoneum.60
Recommendation 10.1: It is recommended that micro-
scopic HGSC be managed as HGSC [V, B].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 3% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 10.2: SEE-FIM is recommended in
RRBSO [IV, A].
Consensus: 85.4% (35) yes, 0% (0) no, 14.6% (6) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 10.3: SEE-FIM is recommended when
there is doubt regarding the origin of the carcinoma
(endometrial, tubal, ovarian, peritoneal) [IV, A].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 10.4: It is suggested that the pathol-
ogist examines microscopically the whole ﬁmbriae in benign
conditions [V, B].
Consensus: 87% (34) yes, 3% (1) no, 10% (4) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 10.5: In STIC, staging of the perito-
neum is recommended [II, A].
Consensus: 97% (38) yes, 3% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 10.6: In STIC, it is recommended that
(re)-staging is carried out, preferably by a minimally invasive
procedure [III, B].
Consensus: 92% (36) yes, 5% (2) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 10.7: In STIC, hysterectomy should be
considered, particularly in patients with a gBRCA1-mut [IV, A].

11. How should patients with advanced tubo-ovarian car-
cinoma
be
selected
for
primary
cytoreductive
surgery?
Evaluation for surgery.The standard treatment for the initial
management of advanced tubo-ovarian carcinoma is primary
cytoreductive surgery (PCS) or, in those not considered suit-
able for upfront surgery, NACT followed by ICS. Randomised
trials have shown, although with some limitations, that in
advanced-stage tubo-ovarian carcinoma, NACT had similar
long-term survival to PCS and improved perioperative out-
comes.61-64 The outcome of patients undergoing PCS in these
trials, however, was unfavourable compared with other
studies.
Structured computed tomography (CT) imaging reports
or diffusion-weighted MRI have been used to predict
tumour load, localisation and the feasibility of complete
resection.65-67 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT
seems as accurate as CT in detecting disease spread, with a
possible small advantage in detecting lymph node and
distant metastases. PETeCT, however, seems to be less
reliable than diffusion-weighted MRI for the detection of
intraperitoneal metastases.68,69
Centres complying with ESGO quality indicators for
advanced ovarian cancer surgery and perioperative man-
agement ensure that patients receive the appropriate
treatment for their disease.70,71 PCS is the preferred
approach if a complete resection seems achievable with
acceptable morbidity. These criteria are different for pa-
tients with LGSC. NACT is less effective in LGSC than in
HGSC and cytoreduction to <1 cm (or optimal) is preferable
to no surgery; a residual tumour 1 cm showed a signiﬁ-
cant advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS).72
Role of lymphadenectomy. The therapeutic value has been
debated for a long time, but recent evidence from a large
phase III randomised trial failed to show therapeutic beneﬁt
of systematic lymphadenectomy for patients with complete
gross resection of peritoneal disease and non-suspicious
lymph nodes both on preoperative imaging and intra-
operative clinical evaluation.73 Additional data have also
shown that a comprehensive lymphadenectomy is of no
beneﬁt in patients with advanced ovarian cancer with rare
histological subtypes.74 The presence of cardiophrenic
lymph nodes in advanced ovarian cancer is a negative
prognostic factor, but the impact of resection of these
lymph nodes on survival remains unknown.75,76
Recommendation 11.1: The selection of patients for PCS or
NACT must be carried out in an accredited ovarian cancer
centre (according to the ESGO quality indicators for ovarian
cancer surgery 2016/2020)in a multidisciplinary setting [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 11.2: PCS is the preferred option and
should be offered if a complete resection seems achievable
[I, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 11.3: PCS is the preferred option in
patients with LGSC if residual disease <1 cm can be ach-
ieved [IV, B].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 11.4: NACT with ICS is a valid alter-
native for patients with a low likelihood of initial complete
resection and with chemosensitive histological types or for
those who are poor surgical candidates due to medical
conditions [I, A].
Consensus: 92% (36) yes, 5% (2) no, 3% (1) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 11.5: Patients should be medically
assessed for surgery, and this should be based on clearly
deﬁned criteria requiring a thorough evaluation by a
specialist in gynaecological oncology. Medically unﬁt pa-
tients should additionally receive an internal medicine and/
or
anaesthesiology
evaluation.
Eastern
Cooperative
Oncology Group and American Society of Anesthesiology
scores must be documented [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (39) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (39
voters)
Recommendation 11.6: Candidates for surgery based on
a multidisciplinary team (MDT) report should proceed to a
laparotomy with the intent of complete cytoreduction
[III, B].
Consensus: 97% (34) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (35
voters)
Recommendation 11.7: Contrast-enhanced CT, MRI and
PETeCT with a structured radiology report are considered
as options for the initial evaluation of patients with
advanced ovarian carcinoma [III, A]. US by an expert so-
nographer may be used to assess tumour extent and
resectability in the pelvis and abdominal cavity [III, C].

Recommendation 11.12: Systematic pelvic and para-
aortic lymphadenectomy should not be carried out in pa-
tients with advanced disease who have undergone intra-
abdominal macroscopically complete resection and have
non-suspicious lymph nodes both on preoperative imaging
and intraoperative clinical evaluation [I, E].

12. What is the role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal ChT
in newly diagnosed tubo-ovarian carcinoma?
One prospective trial of hyperthermic intraperitoneal ChT
(HIPEC) demonstrated an improvement in recurrence-free
survival and OS for patients with FIGO stage III tubo-ovarian
carcinoma who received HIPEC at ICS.77 The results of this
trial have led to considerable discussion.77-80 No consensus on
the role of HIPEC and ICS was reached, which reﬂects the
current difference in opinion among the participants.
13. Which patients should receive bevacizumab, mainte-
nance therapy with PARPis or the combination of
PARPis with bevacizumab and for how long?
In two randomised clinical trials, a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in PFS was seen when bevacizumab was added to
paclitaxelecarboplatin ﬁrst-line therapy followed by bev-
acizumab maintenance compared with ChT alone.81,82
Bevacizumab has shown activity in all tubo-ovarian carci-
noma histotypes, including LGSC, and can be considered as a
maintenance option in less-chemosensitive tumours.83 The
majority of LGSCs present elevated estrogen and progester-
one receptor expression, and retrospective studies suggest
that hormone therapy could have therapeutic value in the
maintenance setting of newly diagnosed advanced LGSC.84
Up
to
50%
of
HGSC
cases
are
associated
with
homologous recombination deﬁciency (HRD).85 Trials have
shown a signiﬁcant prolongation of PFS, greatest among
patients with a tumour BRCA-mut, followed by patients
with BRCA-wt HRD-positive tumours.86 The PFS results in
BRCA-wt HRD-negative tumours are less conclusive with
some trials reporting a beneﬁt12,87 (niraparib is FDA and
EMA approved as maintenance monotherapy; rucaparib is
EMA approved as maintenance monotherapy) and others
showing no improvement.13
Recommendation
13.1:
Molecular
characteristics
of
tumour, patients and disease-related factors should be
considered in the decision-making process for maintenance
options [II, B].
Consensus: 100% (36) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (36
voters)
Recommendation 13.2: The use of bevacizumab in
combination with ChT and as maintenance is recommended
independently from any biomarker [I, A].
Consensus: 89% (33) yes, 8% (3) no, 3% (1) abstain (37
voters)
Recommendation 13.3: Bevacizumab should be admin-
istered in combination with platinumepaclitaxel ChT and as
maintenance for a maximum of 15 months [I, A].
Consensus: 97% (33) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (34

[II, A]. ChT followed by maintenance with endocrine therapy
is an option in stage III and IV tumours [IV, B].

Recommendation 13.6: Patients with HGSC/high-grade
EC and BRCA-muts or genomic instability score (GIS)-posi-
tive (with a validated test) in complete response (CR)/par-
tial response (PR)/no evidence of disease (NED) after

Recommendation 13.7: Patients with HGSC/high-grade
EC without a BRCA-mut and who are GIS-negative (with a
validated test) may receive platinum-based ChT in combi-
nation with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab main-
tenance or platinum-based ChT followed by niraparib or

Recommendation
13.8:
Patients
with
HGSC/high-

Recommendation 13.9: When used as maintenance in
patients in CR/PR/NED to platinum-based ChT, olaparib
(alone or in combination with bevacizumab) and rucaparib
are recommended for 2 years, and niraparib is recom-
mended for 3 years [I, A].

14. How should older/frail patients with tubo-ovarian
carcinoma be investigated and treated?
Older patients are under-represented in clinical trials due
to their poor performance status (PS) and comorbidities,88
and their outcomes are poorer.89 Geriatric assessment
gathers information on functional, mental and nutritional
status, emotional conditions and social support.90 Vulner-
ability scores have been validated in clinical trials.90,91
Surgery, frequently carried out in an emergency context
and in unspecialised centres, is often incomplete, with
higher
post-operative
complications.92
ChT
may
be
underutilised.93,94
Recommendation 14.1: Patients should not be excluded
from diagnostic procedures, clinical trials and speciﬁc
treatments for tubo-ovarian carcinoma based only on
chronological age [IV, D].
Consensus: 100% (35) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (35
voters)
Recommendation 14.2: Vulnerability should be assessed
in patients 70 years or any age with at least two comor-
bidities, if possible, with the support of a geriatric specialist
[IV, A]. This assessment should focus on patient functions
(activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily
living), nutrition, psychological well-being, comorbidities
and concomitant medications [II, A] and should not delay
the start of therapy [IV, A].
Consensus: 97% (35) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (36

15. What is the role of surgery in recurrent tubo-ovarian
carcinoma?
The aims of surgery are either therapeutic cytoreduction
or palliation. Two of three randomised trials of cytoreduc-
tive surgery at ﬁrst relapse have shown an improvement in
PFS, and one has shown an OS beneﬁt in operated versus
non-operated patients.95-97
No prospective randomised evidence exists regarding the
evaluation of the beneﬁt of cytoreductive surgery for sub-
sequent relapses. Data are based on a multicentre retro-
spective series for tertiary and quaternary cytoreductive
surgery.98
Palliative surgical intervention for bowel obstruction in
peritoneally disseminated tubo-ovarian carcinoma is chal-
lenging. Surgical bypass or stoma formation and non-
surgical
therapies,
such
as
bowel
decompression,

endoscopic stent placements and percutaneous endoscopic
gastrostomies, can be considered if conservative pharma-
cological management is not working. Surgical morbidity is
high99 and an MDT expert approach is crucial.
Oligometastatic disease (OMD) deﬁnitions vary according
to tumour type and diagnostic method. The most frequent
sites of OMD include lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung, bone
and brain.100,101 The site of the disease is an important
independent prognostic factor.100 Surgery, inﬁeld radio-
therapy (RT) and thermal ablation are all used for OMD.
Recommendation 15.1: Patients with tubo-ovarian car-
cinoma in ﬁrst relapse >6 months since the end of ﬁrst-line
platinum-based ChT should be assessed for secondary
cytoreductive surgery in a gynaecological oncology centre
experienced in surgery for ovarian cancer [I, A].
Consensus: 100% (35) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (35
voters)
Recommendation 15.2: Prospectively validated algo-
rithms should be used as a guide to identify optimal can-
didates for secondary cytoreductive surgery with complete
tumour resection [I, A].
Consensus: 100% (35) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (35
voters)
Recommendation 15.3: NACT before cytoreductive sur-
gery at relapse cannot be recommended outside of clinical
trials [IV, D].
Consensus: 75.6% (31) yes, 9.8% (4) no, 14.6% (6) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 15.4: HIPEC is not recommended in
cytoreductive surgery for relapsed disease [II, D].
Consensus: 97% (33) yes, 3% (1) no, 0% (0) abstain (34
voters)
Recommendation 15.5: Cytoreductive surgery could be
offered to patients with subsequent relapses in whom
complete resection appears feasible [III, B].
Consensus: 81% (29) yes, 8% (3) no, 11% (4) abstain (36
voters)
Recommendation 15.6: In selected patients, palliative
surgery to relieve mechanical obstruction may be indicated
after failure of conservative measures, either to remove the
tumour obstructing the bowel or to carry out a diversion
procedure such as a stoma [IV, B]. These patients should be
managed within an MDT [IV, A].
Consensus: 97.6% (40) yes, 0% (0) no, 2.4% (1) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 15.7: Palliative surgery should be offered
only after careful consideration in patients with unfavourable
conditions, such as rapidly progressing disease without
further systemic options, gastric outlet/upper gastrointestinal
obstruction and multilevel sites of obstruction [IV, B].
Consensus: 92.7% (38) yes, 4.9% (2) no, 2.4% (1) abstain
(41 voters)
Recommendation 15.8: For oligometastatic recurrence,
several treatment modalities such as surgery, inﬁeld RT
and thermal ablation should be considered within an MDT
[IV, B].
Consensus: 97% (34) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (35
voters)
Recommendation 15.9: The following factors should be
considered to decide treatment modality for oligometa-
static recurrence: site of recurrence, time to recurrence,
number of lesions, treatment-related morbidity, patient PS,
type of maintenance treatments and patient preferences,
regardless of their BRCA status [IV, B].
Consensus: 100% (34) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (34
voters)
Recommendation 15.10: After local ablative/surgical
tumour
management,
continuation
of
maintenance
treatment with the same regimen could be considered
[IV, C].
Consensus: 94% (32) yes, 3% (1) no, 3% (1) abstain (34
voters)
16. What is the role of molecularly targeted therapy in
recurrent disease?
The selection of molecularly targeted therapy with
platinum-based
therapydcurrently
bevacizumab
or
PARPisdis driven by biological factors, prior use of
molecularly targeted therapy and regulatory approvals.
Bevacizumab added to platinum-based ChT and continued
as maintenance increases the tumour response rate and PFS
without an OS beneﬁt.
In randomised trials, PARPis signiﬁcantly prolonged PFS in
the recurrent setting, when given as maintenance after
response to platinum until progression or unacceptable
toxicity. This beneﬁt was more pronounced in patients with
a BRCA-mut but still relevant in patients with BRCA-wt tu-
mours regardless of HRD status. Their use in recurrent dis-
ease is currently diminishing as they are now often used
after ﬁrst-line ChT (see Question 13). Second-line molecu-
larly targeted therapy needs to take account of ﬁrst-line
treatment. Rechallenge with the same molecularly tar-
geted drug is currently experimental and does not have
regulatory approval. It is an area where more research is
needed.
Patients on maintenance treatment should be monitored
proactively to manage potential side-effects102 and ensure a
continued optimal clinical beneﬁt.103-106
Recommendation 16.1: For patients with BRCA-mutated
tumours, eligible for platinum and no prior PARPis and no
prior bevacizumab use, a platinum-based combination fol-
lowed by PARPis is recommended after CR/PR/NED [I, A].
Bevacizumab may still be considered depending on pa-
tient’s symptoms and response to ChT [II, B].
Consensus: 94% (32) yes, 3% (1) no, 3% (1) abstain (34
voters)
Recommendation 16.2: For patients with BRCA-wt or
unknown tumours eligible for platinum and no prior
PARPis and no prior bevacizumab, maintenance therapy is
recommended with PARPis (after CR/PR/NED) or bev-
acizumab. Bevacizumab added to ChT followed by main-
tenance should be prioritised for patients in need of rapid
symptom control [I, A].
Consensus: 97% (34) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (35
voters)

Recommendation 16.3: For patients eligible for platinum
and no prior PARPis but prior bevacizumab, platinum-based
ChT followed by PARPi maintenance is preferred as long as
CR/PR/NED is achieved, regardless of their BRCA and HRD
status [I, A].
Consensus: 97% (30) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (31
voters)
Recommendation 16.4: For patients eligible for platinum
and prior PARPis but no prior bevacizumab, a platinum-
based combination with bevacizumab followed by mainte-
nance should be recommended [I, A]. The preferred ChT
partner for
bevacizumab
in the
recurrent setting is
carboplatinepegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) [I, A].
Consensus: 90% (27) yes, 3% (1) no, 7% (2) abstain (30
voters)
Recommendation 16.5: For patients eligible for platinum
and prior use of bevacizumab and PARPis, a platinum-based
ChT should still be recommended [I, B] and rechallenge
options of maintenance agents could be considered (see
recommendations 16.9, 16.11).
Consensus: 97% (29) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (30
voters)
Recommendation 16.6: Monitoring of safety should be
carried out according to drug-speciﬁc recommendations,
with special focus on late safety issues [I, A].
Consensus: 100% (30) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (30
voters)
Recommendation 16.7: Routine oncological follow-up is
recommended including imaging and/or CA-125 according
to local practice and after discussion with the patient [III, C].
Consensus: 97% (30) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (31
voters)
Recommendation 16.8: In the recurrent setting, the
duration of PARPis as maintenance should be until pro-
gressive disease or unacceptable toxicity [I, A].
Consensus: 100% (32) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (32
voters)
Recommendation
16.9:
Bevacizumab
rechallenge
in
combination with platinum should be considered in pa-
tients already pre-treated with bevacizumab in the ﬁrst line
[I, A].
Consensus: 91% (29) yes, 6% (2) no, 3% (1) abstain (32
voters)
Recommendation 16.10: The preferred ChT partner for
bevacizumab (rechallenge) in the recurrent setting is
carboplatinePLD [I, A].
Consensus: 97% (29) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (30
voters)
Recommendation
16.11:
Patients
in
response
to
platinum-based ChT after prior PARPi maintenance therapy
may be considered for a PARPi-maintenance rechallenge
given a duration of prior PARPi exposure of 18 months in
the ﬁrst line and 12 months in further lines or 12 months
and 6 months for patients with a BRCA-mut or BRCA-wt
status, respectively [II, B].
Consensus: 94% (29) yes, 0% (0) no, 6% (2) abstain (31
voters)
17. What is the role of non-platinum drugs and support-
ive care options?
Non-platinum drugs and supportive care options are
mainly used in patients not eligible for platinum rechallenge
due to progression on platinum-based therapy or after a
short treatment-free interval (TFI). The prognosis of these
patients is poor and the main treatment objectives are
symptom palliation and maintenance of QoL. Non-platinum
ChT is given alone or with bevacizumab.107,108 In LGSC,
endocrine therapy or trametinib is used.50 The efﬁcacy of
available therapies is limited and patients should be offered
participation in new clinical trials when possible.109
There are no validated predictive factors to identify pa-
tients who may beneﬁt from palliative ChT. Low baseline
global health status, poor physical function and the pres-
ence of abdominal/gastrointestinal symptoms are pre-
dictors of early discontinuation.
Recommendation 17.1: For patients progressing on
platinum-based therapy or after a short TFI or for those
who are intolerant of platinum and not eligible for platinum
rechallenge,
various
management
options
should
be
considered, ranging from non-platinum single-agent sys-
temic therapy to supportive care alone [I, A].
Consensus: 97% (30) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (31
voters)
Recommendation 17.2: Patients should be included in
clinical trials, when possible, as there is a signiﬁcant need
for improved treatment options in this setting [IV, A].
Consensus: 100% (41) yes, 0% (0) no, 0% (0) abstain (41
voters)
Recommendation 17.3: For patients who have not
received prior bevacizumab, the addition of this agent to
weekly paclitaxel, PLD or topotecan should be considered
[I, A]. The combination of weekly paclitaxel and bev-
acizumab is the preferred option based on trial subset
analysis [II, A].
Consensus: 87% (26) yes, 3% (1) no, 10% (3) abstain (30
voters)
Recommendation 17.4: The combination of trabectedin
and PLD could be considered in those patients who are
intolerant to platinum who have relapsed after 6 months
from the last platinum dose [II, C].
Consensus: 77% (24) yes, 16% (5) no, 6% (2) abstain (31
voters)
Recommendation 17.5: Patients with LGSC relapse
should be considered for treatment with trametinib after
platinum failure [I, A] or for endocrine therapy [II, A].
Consensus: 97% (30) yes, 0% (0) no, 3% (1) abstain (31
voters)
Recommendation 17.6: Supportive care alone should be
considered when expected beneﬁt of ChT is limited [III, A].

Recommendation 17.7: Systematic assessment of QoL
and symptoms during treatment is recommended to start
early supportive care and prevent or improve symptoms,
QoL and survival [III, A].
Consensus: 88% (28) yes, 9% (3) no, 3% (1) abstain (32
voters)
18. What is recommended regarding evaluation of QoL/
survivorship issues and follow-up after treatment?
Treatment and tumour-related symptoms are often
underestimated and can be present during treatment and
follow-up. Symptoms and QoL should be assessed as early
as possible and patients should have access to early sup-
portive care which may improve symptoms, QoL and sur-
vival.
This
includes
psycho-oncology,
social
care,
physiotherapy and patient support groups.
Oncological follow-up aims to detect recurrence and/or
secondary cancers, monitor QoL, manage iatrogenic toxicity
and provide holistic supportive care.
There is no standard protocol or frequency for follow-up.
A reasonable approach involves patient assessment every 3-
4 months for the ﬁrst 2 years and every 6 months during
years 3-5. Follow-up may be individualised according to
prognostic factors and treatment modalities, e.g. mainte-
nance therapy. Follow-up beyond 5 years should be dis-
cussed individually.110,111
Recommendation 18.1: QoL and symptom assessment via
validated tools could be considered as part of the routine
follow-up in all patients with ovarian carcinoma [IV, C].
Consensus: 96% (26) yes, 0% (0) no, 4% (1) abstain (27
voters)
Recommendation 18.2: Long-term follow-up is recom-
mended for all patients with tubo-ovarian carcinoma by a
physician experienced in the treatment and follow-up of
patients with gynaecological cancer [III, A].
Consensus: 90% (27) yes, 10% (3) no, 0% (0) abstain (30
voters)
