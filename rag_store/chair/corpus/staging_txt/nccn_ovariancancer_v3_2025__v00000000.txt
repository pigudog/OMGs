UPDATES
Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer from Version 3.2024 include:
Continued
LCOC-9
• Pathologic diagnosis pathway modified: Imaging C/A/P CT with contrast if not previously done.
Bullet added: eg, C/A/P CT, chest CT, A/P MRI, PET/CT, or PET/MRI.
LCOC-10
• Bullet 5 modified: Imaging as clinically indicated: eg, C/A/P CT, chest CT, A/P MRI, PET/CT, PET/MRI (skull base to mid-thigh). (also for LCOC-13)
LCOC-12
• Incompletely staged, modified: Imaging if not previously done (eg, C/A/P CT, chest CT, A/P MRI, PET/CT, PET/MRI) with contrast (if not previously
done).
LCOC-A
• Footnote removed: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab.
LCOC-B
• Surveillance for Malignant Germ Cell Tumors extensively revised.
• Footnote a added: Only for those patients who have a residual ovary.
OV-A (3 of 4)
• Interval Debulking Surgery After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
Bullet 2 modified: HIPEC with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) can be considered at the time of IDS for stage III disease. HIPEC can also be considered for
suitable stage IV patients (category 2B) who have had a favorable response to neoadjuvant therapy both intraperitoneally and extraperitoneally,
or in whom stage IV disease sites have completely resolved (eg, resolution of malignant pleural effusion) or are now deemed resectable. Sodium
thiosulfate may be administered at the start of perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal protection during HIPEC.
Bullet 5 modified: While systemic lymphadenectomy of clinical-negative nodes is not recommended, suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be
resected, if possible. Removal of lymph nodes noted to have potential metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis should be considered, even if not
currently suspicious or enlarged.
OV-A (4 of 4)
• Special Circumstances, bullet 1, sub-bullet, second sentence added: Consider endometrial sampling to exclude synchronous primary or hyperplasia.
OV-B (2 of 3)
• Less Common Ovarian Cancers (LCOC)
Bullet 3, last sentence added: Features favoring primary ovarian carcinoma versus metastasis are: unilateral, "expansile" pattern of invasion, complex
papillary pattern, size >10 cm, smooth external surface, microscopic cystic glands, necrotic luminal debris, mural nodules, and accompanying
teratoma, adenofibroma, endometriosis, or Brenner tumor.
OV-B (2 of 3)(continued)
Bullet 4 added: Most early stage invasive mucinous ovarian cancers have an expansile pattern of growth characterized by complex glandular,
papillary and/or cribriform architecture with a labyrinthine or anastomosing pattern and little or no intervening stroma. About 20% have an infiltrative
pattern of destructive invasion of haphazardly arranged and angulated tumor cell nests into a desmoplastic stroma and measuring at least 5 mm in
linear extent - and this has been associated with an increased risk of relapse and mortality.
Bullet 5 modified: Metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas also usually are positive for CK20 and CEA.
Bullet 6, second sentence modified: Endometrioid adenocarcinomas are usually positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), PAX8, CA-125, and estrogen
receptors.

UPDATES
Updates in Version 1.2025 of the NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer from Version 3.2024 include:
OV-C (1 of 12)
• General
Bullet 3, sub-bullet 2 modified: Patients of childbearing potential who desire fertility-sparing procedures should be referred to an appropriate
fertility specialist (see Fertility, Reproductive Endocrine, and Sexual Health Considerations for Individuals with Ovaries in the NCCN Guidelines for
Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) Oncology).
Bullet 8 added: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for any recommended systemic biologic therapy in the NCCN Guidelines.
OV-C (2 of 12)
• Language updated: "Surgery" has replaced "IDS" throughout this page.
• Bullet 2 modified: Any of the primary IV regimens for stage II–IV high-grade serous carcinoma and respective LCOCs can be used as neoadjuvant
therapy before surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy does not apply to LMP and other noninvasive cancers. See OV-C (6 of 12) and LCOC-A.
• Bullet 4 modified: After neoadjuvant therapy and surgery any of the adjuvant therapy options for high-grade serious carcinoma (IV or IP/IV) and
respective LCOCs can be considered. Neoadjuvant therapy does not apply to LMP and other noninvasive cancers. See OV-C (6 of 12) and LCOC-A.
OV-C (3 of 12)
• Principles of Maintenance PARP Inhibitor (PARPi) Therapy, bullet 3, sub-bullet 7 added: Current clinical HRD tests are proxy measures of HRD and
lack accuracy in fully predicting functional HRD. HRD testing is recommended for those patients without germline BRCA1/2 mutations as HRD test
status may provide information on the magnitude of benefit of PARP inhibitor maintenance therapy in these patients. The Panel considers the use of
PARPi in patients who have HRP tumors, at present, to be of minimal benefit.
OV-C (4 of 12)
• Bullet 9 moved from OV-C (9A of 12): Patients who do not respond and progress on two consecutive regimens without evidence of clinical benefits
have diminished likelihood of benefitting from additional therapy (Griffiths RW, et al. Int J Gynecol Cancer 2011;21:58-65). Decisions to offer clinical
trials, supportive care, or additional therapy should be made on an individual basis.
OV-C (5 of 12)
• Mucinous carcinoma row header modified: Mucinous carcinoma (stage IA, IB, and IC, grades 1–3).
OV-C (6 of 12)
• Footnote h, sentence removed: See the NCCN Guidelines for Older Adult Oncology.
• Footnote removed: An FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for bevacizumab. (also for OV-C [7 of 12], [8 of 12] and [9A of 12]).
OV-C (8 of 12)
• Useful in Certain Circumstances, Targeted Therapy
Regimen added: Fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (for HER2-positive tumors [IHC 3+ or 2+])(category 2B).
Regimen added: Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx (for FRα-expressing tumors [≥75% positive tumor cells]).
Regimen modified: Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx/bevacizumab (for FRα-expressing tumors [≥50% positive tumor cells])(category 2B).
OV-C (8 of 12)(continued)
• Footnote y added: For patients treated with two prior lines of platinum-based therapy.
• Footnote removed: Patients who progress on two consecutive regimens without evidence of clinical benefits have diminished likelihood of benefitting
from additional therapy (Griffiths RW, et al. Int J Gynecol Cancer 2011;21:58-65). Decisions to offer clinical trials, supportive care, or additional therapy
should be made on an individual basis. (Also for OV-C [9A of 12])
OV-C (9 of 12)
• Useful in Certain Circumstances, Targeted Therapy
Regimen modified: Mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx/bevacizumab (for FRα-expressing tumors [≥25% positive tumor cells]).
Regimen added: For mucinous carcinoma: FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab (category 2B).

•	All patients with suspected ovarian malignancies; published data demonstrate that
primary assessment and debulking by a gynecologic oncologist results in a survival
advantage.
•	Patients being evaluated for neoadjuvant therapy prior to being considered a poor

b Due to emerging therapeutics for LCOC, there is value in identifying potential pathways for rare cancers and it may be useful for clinical trial recruitment. Tumor
molecular testing can be considered, if not previously done, as it may help guide treatment. There are limited data in these cancers given their infrequency and it will
be difficult to acquire prospective data. Individualized treatment may be the best treatment for these rare tumors. [Committee on the State of the Science in Ovarian

• Imaging as clinically indicatedp (eg, C/A/P CT, chest
CT, A/P MRI, PET/CT, or PET/MRI) (skull base to mid-
thigh)

Observation
f See Principles of Systemic Therapy (OV-C) and Management of Drug Reactions
(OV-D).
o Validated molecular testing should be performed in a CLIA-approved facility
using the most recent available tumor tissue. Tumor molecular analysis is
recommended to include, at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from
targeted therapeutics that have tumor-specific or tumor-agnostic benefit including,
but not limited to, HER2 status (by IHC), BRCA1/2, HRD status, MSI, MMR,
TMB, BRAF, FRα (FOLR1), RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include these
markers. More comprehensive testing may be particularly important in LCOC with
limited approved therapeutic options (OV-B).
p CT is performed with oral and iodinated IV contrast (unless contraindicated due
to anaphylaxis or significant renal dysfunction) with or without rectal contrast. MRI
is performed with gadolinium-based contrast agents (unless contraindicated due
to anaphylaxis) and is preferred in select patients with renal dysfunction over CT.
Chest CT can be done with or without iodinated IV contrast.
q There are data regarding the utility of CA-125 for monitoring of ovarian cancer
after completion of primary therapy. See The Society of Gynecologic Oncology
(SGO) position statement and Discussion.
r See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian,
Pancreatic, and Prostate and NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk
Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and Gastric.
s There is no standard sequencing of drugs for recurrent disease. Considerations
include prior therapies, disease burden, relative efficacy, and relative toxicity
profile.
t Consider secondary cytoreduction in patients with long disease-free interval,
isolated masses rather than diffuse carcinomatosis on imaging, and/or bowel
obstruction.
u An aromatase inhibitor (ie, letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane) is preferred
if not used previously. Fulvestrant, leuprolide acetate, or goserelin acetate is
recommended if an aromatase inhibitor was given previously.
v Data are limited on maintenance therapy for recurrent/resistant LCOC. See OV-8
for maintenance options after platinum-based therapy, and patient selection
criteria.

PRINCIPLES OF SURGERY1
General Considerations
• It is recommended that a gynecologic oncologist perform the appropriate surgery.
• An open laparotomy including a vertical midline abdominal incision should be used in most patients with a suspected malignant ovarian/
fallopian tube/primary peritoneal neoplasm in whom a surgical staging procedure, a primary debulking procedure, an interval debulking
procedure, or secondary cytoreduction is planned.
For select patients, a minimally invasive surgical approach may be used by an experienced surgeon to manage early-stage disease.
Laparoscopy may be useful to evaluate whether optimal cytoreduction can be achieved in patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage
or recurrent disease.
Minimally invasive techniques can be used for select patients for interval debulking procedures. Patients who are unable to be optimally
debulked using minimally invasive techniques should be converted to an open procedure.
• Intraoperative pathologic evaluation with frozen sections may assist in management.
• Prior to surgery for ovarian cancer, counsel patients about port placement if intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is being considered.
Operative Reports
• Surgeons should describe the following in the operative report:
Extent of initial disease before debulking pelvis, mid-abdomen, or upper abdomen (cutoffs: pelvic brim to lower ribs).
Amount of residual disease in the same areas after debulking.
Complete or incomplete resection; if incomplete, indicate the size of the major lesion and total number of lesions. Indicate if miliary or
small lesions.

Discussion
Newly Diagnosed Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Apparently Confined to the Ovaries, Fallopian Tubes, and Uterus (apparent stage IA–IIA)
In general, every effort should be made during a primary cytoreduction procedure to achieve maximum cytoreduction of all pelvic disease and
to evaluate for occult disease in the upper abdomen or retroperitoneum.
• On entering the abdomen, aspiration of ascites or peritoneal lavage should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations.
• All peritoneal surfaces should be visualized, and any peritoneal surface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be
selectively excised or biopsied. In the absence of any suspicious areas, random peritoneal biopsies should be taken from the pelvis,
paracolic gutters, and undersurfaces of the diaphragm (diaphragm scraping for Papanicolaou stain is an acceptable alternative).
• BSO and hysterectomy should be performed with every effort to keep an encapsulated mass intact during removal.
• For selected patients desiring to preserve fertility, USO or BSO with uterine preservation may be considered. Uterine preservation allows for
potential future assisted reproductive approaches.
• Omentectomy should be performed.
• Para-aortic lymph node dissection should be performed by stripping the nodal tissue from the vena cava and the aorta bilaterally to at least
the level of the inferior mesenteric artery and preferably to the level of the renal vessels.
• The preferred method of dissecting pelvic lymph nodes is bilateral removal of lymph nodes overlying and anterolateral to the common iliac
vessel, overlying and medial to the external iliac vessel, overlying and medial to the hypogastric vessels, and from the obturator fossa at a
minimum anterior to the obturator nerve.2
Newly Diagnosed Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Involving the Pelvis and Upper Abdomen (stage >IIB)
In general, every effort should be made during a primary cytoreduction procedure to achieve maximum cytoreduction of all abdominal, pelvic,
and retroperitoneal disease. Residual disease <1 cm defines optimal cytoreduction; however, maximal effort should be made to remove all
gross disease since this offers superior survival outcomes.3
• Aspiration of ascites (if present) should be performed for peritoneal cytologic examinations. All involved omentum should be removed.
• Suspicious and/or enlarged nodes, identified on preoperative imaging or during surgical exploration, should be resected, if possible.
Resection of clinically negative nodes is not required.4
• Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical cytoreduction (in all stages) include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping
of the diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy, partial
gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.
• Select patients with low-volume residual disease after surgical cytoreduction for invasive epithelial ovarian or peritoneal cancer are potential
candidates for IP therapy. In these patients, consideration should be given to placement of IP catheter with initial surgery.

Interval Debulking Surgery After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy of
Invasive Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
As with a primary debulking procedure, every effort should be made
to achieve maximum cytoreduction during an interval debulking
procedure. Maximal effort should be made to remove all gross
disease in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. Consultation
with a gynecologic oncologist is recommended.
• IDS, including completion hysterectomy and BSO with staging,
should be performed after 3–4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
for patients with a response to chemotherapy or stable disease.
Alternate timing of surgery has not been prospectively evaluated but
may be considered based on individual patient-centered factors.
• HIPEC with cisplatin (100 mg/m2) can be considered at the time of
IDS for stage III disease. HIPEC can also be considered for suitable
stage IV patients (category 2B) who have had a favorable response
to neoadjuvant therapy both intraperitoneally and extraperitoneally,
or in whom stage IV disease sites have completely resolved (eg,
resolution of malignant pleural effusion) or are now deemed
resectable. Sodium thiosulfate may be administered at the start
of perfusion, followed by a continuous infusion, to allow for renal
protection during HIPEC.
• All peritoneal surfaces should be visualized, and any peritoneal
surface or adhesion suspicious for harboring metastasis should be
selectively excised or biopsied.
• An omentectomy should be performed.
• While systematic lymphadenectomy of clinical-negative nodes is
not recommended, suspicious and/or enlarged nodes should be
resected, if possible.
• Procedures that may be considered for optimal surgical debulking
include bowel resection and/or appendectomy, stripping of the
diaphragm or other peritoneal surfaces, splenectomy, partial
cystectomy and/or ureteroneocystostomy, partial hepatectomy,
partial gastrectomy, cholecystectomy, and/or distal pancreatectomy.
Risk-Reducing Salpingo-Oophorectomy (RRSO) Protocol
• For information on when RRSO is indicated, see NCCN Guidelines
for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian,
Pancreatic, and Prostate.
• Perform minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.
• Survey upper abdomen, bowel surfaces, omentum, appendix (if
present), and pelvic organs.
• Biopsy any abnormal peritoneal findings.
• Obtain pelvic washing for cytology (50 cc normal saline instilled and
aspirated immediately).
• Perform total BSO, removing 2 cm of proximal ovarian vasculature/
IP ligament, all tube up to the cornua, and all peritoneum
surrounding the ovaries and tubes, especially peritoneum
underlying areas of adhesion between tube and/or ovary and the
pelvic sidewall.5
• Engage in minimal instrument handling of the tubes and ovaries to
avoid traumatic exfoliation of cells.5
• Both ovaries and tubes should be placed in an endobag for retrieval
from the pelvis.
• Both ovaries and tubes should be processed by sectioning and
extensively examining the fimbriated end (SEE-FIM) protocol.6
• If occult malignancy or serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC)
is identified, provide referral to a gynecologic oncologist.
• The prevention benefits of salpingectomy alone are not yet proven.
If considered, the fallopian tube from the fimbria to its insertion into
the uterus should be removed. In addition, the fallopian tube should
be processed and assessed as described above. The concern for
risk-reducing salpingectomy alone is that patients are still at risk for
developing ovarian cancer. In addition, in premenopausal patients,
oophorectomy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer but the
magnitude is uncertain. See NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial
High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate.

Special Circumstances
• Fertility-sparing surgery:
Fertility-sparing surgery with USO (preserving the uterus and contralateral ovary) or BSO (preserving the uterus) can be considered for
patients with apparent early-stage disease and/or low-risk tumors (early-stage invasive epithelial tumors, LMP lesions, malignant germ cell
tumors, mucinous tumors, or malignant sex cord-stromal tumors) who wish to preserve fertility. Consider endometrial sampling to exclude
synchronous primary or hyperplasia. Refer to reproductive endocrinologist for evaluation and REI consultation as clinically indicated.
Comprehensive surgical staging should still be performed to rule out occult higher stage disease but may be omitted in pediatric,
adolescent, and young adult patients with clinically apparent early-stage malignant germ cell tumors based on the pediatric surgical
literature.7
• Mucinous tumors: Primary invasive mucinous tumors of the ovary are uncommon. Thus, the upper and lower GI tract should be carefully
evaluated to rule out an occult GI primary with ovarian metastases, and an appendectomy need only be performed in patients with a
suspected or confirmed mucinous ovarian neoplasm if it appears to be abnormal. A normal appendix does not require surgical resection in
this setting. If mucinous histology is confirmed by intraoperative frozen section analysis and there are no suspicious lymph nodes, consider
omitting lymphadenectomy.
• Ovarian borderline epithelial (LMP) tumors: Although data show upstaging with lymphadenectomy, other data show that lymphadenectomy
does not affect overall survival. However, omentectomy and multiple biopsies of peritoneum (the most common sites of peritoneal implants)
may upstage patients in approximately 30% of cases and may affect prognosis.
• Secondary cytoreduction: A secondary cytoreduction procedure can be considered in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who develop
a recurrence more than 6 months since completion of initial chemotherapy, have a good performance status, have no ascites, and have
an isolated focus or limited foci of disease amenable to complete resection. In addition to preoperative imaging, laparoscopy may be used
to determine if complete resection can be achieved. Secondary cytoreduction can be performed with either open or minimally invasive
approaches. Consider using validated scoring methods to assess suitability for secondary cytoreduction.
Ancillary Palliative Surgical Procedures8
These procedures may be appropriate in select patients:
• Paracentesis/indwelling peritoneal catheter
• Thoracentesis/pleurodesis/video-assisted thoracoscopy/indwelling pleural catheter
• Ureteral stents/nephrostomy
• Gastrostomy tube/intestinal stents/surgical relief of intestinal obstruction

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY
Continued
General
• The complete histologic classification from the WHO is included in
the NCCN Guidelines (WHO Histologic Classification on OV-E).1 The
WHO pathology manual is also a useful resource.1
• Most ovarian cancers, including the LCOC, are diagnosed after
pathologic analysis of a biopsy or surgical specimen. Fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) should be avoided for diagnosis of ovarian cancer
in patients with presumed early-stage disease to prevent rupturing
the cyst and spilling malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity.
However, FNA may be necessary in patients with bulky disease who
are not candidates for primary debulking.2,3
• Both primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers are usually
diagnosed postoperatively (if there is no major involvement of the
ovary) or preoperatively (if there is a biopsy and the patient has
already had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy). Primary peritoneal
and fallopian tube cancers are treated in the same manner as
epithelial ovarian cancer.
• The CAP protocol is a useful tool for pathology reports.4
Pathologic assessment should include:
Elements from CAP protocol4:
 ◊Tumor site(s) (eg, ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneum)
 ◊Tumor size(s)
 ◊Other tissue/organ involvement
 ◊Ovarian/fallopian tumors: surface involvement (present/absent/
cannot determine), specimen integrity (capsule/serosa intact/
fractured/fragmented)
 ◊Histologic type and grade
 ◊Extension and/or implants (if sampled/identified)
 ◊Cytology: peritoneal or ascitic fluid or washings/pleural fluid
 ◊Lymph nodes: number and location of nodes examined, size of
largest metastatic deposits
 ◊STIC, endometriosis (particularly if in continuity with
endometrioid or clear cell carcinoma), and/or endosalpingiosis
 ◊Staging information (FIGO and TNM)
• Tumor molecular analyses
In the upfront setting, choice of somatic testing should, at a
minimum, optimize identification of molecular alterations that
can inform use of interventions that have demonstrated benefit in
this setting, including BRCA1/2, loss of heterozygosity (LOH), or
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status in the absence
of a germline BRCA mutation.
In the recurrence setting, tumor molecular analysis is
recommended to include, as appropriate, tests to identify potential
benefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumor-specific or
tumor-agnostic benefit including, but not limited to, HER2 status
(by IHC), BRCA1/2, HRD status, microsatellite instability (MSI),
mismatch repair (MMR), tumor mutational burden (TMB), BRAF,
FRα (FOLR1), RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include
these markers. More comprehensive testing may be particularly
important in less common histologies with limited approved
therapeutic options. It is recommended that such testing be
performed on the most recent available tumor tissue.
Molecular analyses may be performed on circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA or liquid biopsy) when tissue-based analysis is not
clinically feasible.
Validated molecular testing should be performed in a CLIA-
approved facility.
