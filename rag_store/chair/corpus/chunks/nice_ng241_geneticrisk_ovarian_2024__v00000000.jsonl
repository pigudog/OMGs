Although in this guideline, the term ovarian cancer is used\nthroughout, there is now evidence that most high-grade serous cancers (the most\ncommon type of ovarian cancer) arise from the distal fallopian tube from a precursor lesion\nreferred to as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC).\nIn the UK, between 340,000 and 440,000 women have a pathogenic variant associated\nwith an increased risk of ovarian cancer. This includes pathogenic variants in BRCA1,\nBRCA2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 genes. It is estimated\nthat 15% to 20% of those with high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer also carry a pathogenic\nvariant associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.\nMost of the people who carry a pathogenic variant for ovarian cancer do not have a family\nhistory suggestive of a genetic risk. This means many people have not sought testing for\nhigh-risk ovarian cancer pathogenic variants. Current best estimates are that only 3% of\npeople with a pathogenic variant know that they are carriers.

Current best estimates are that only 3% of\npeople with a pathogenic variant know that they are carriers.

This guideline recommends how to assess the risk\nof having a pathogenic variant and the risk of developing ovarian cancer, what risk-\nreducing interventions should or should not be offered, and what information and support\nshould be given.\nThe guideline does not cover risk management and decision-making support for people\nborn with male reproductive organs who have, or are at risk of having, a pathogenic\nvariant associated with ovarian cancer.
