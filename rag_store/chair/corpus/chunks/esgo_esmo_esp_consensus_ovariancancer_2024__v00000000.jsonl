What is the role of non-platinum drugs and support-\nive care options?\nNon-platinum drugs and supportive care options are\nmainly used in patients not eligible for platinum rechallenge\ndue to progression on platinum-based therapy or after a\nshort treatment-free interval (TFI). The prognosis of these\npatients is poor and the main treatment objectives are\nsymptom palliation and maintenance of QoL.
