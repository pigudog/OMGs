The footprints from mutational\nprocesses active early in tumourigenesis may not reﬂect\ncontemporaneous activity of DNA repair mechanisms.\nGenomic scars will be detected within relapsed tumours\neven if they have developed treatment resistance. Impor-\ntantly, at present, none of the DNA sequencing approaches\nassess the presence of the known mechanism of clinical\nresistance, namely HR gene reversion. It seems logical that\nthe known reversion events should be included in genomic\nassays and further research is needed to elucidate the full\nrange of mechanisms of clinical resistance. Another route to\ntackling this problem might be measuring changes in sub-\nclone speciﬁc mutational signatures across serial samples. It\nremains that, based on the biology of the disease, we\ncannot rely on any of the existing tests to accurately predict\nwhether HRD is extant at the time of treatment or not.
