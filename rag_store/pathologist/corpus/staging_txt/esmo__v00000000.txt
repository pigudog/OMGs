Background: Homologous recombination repair deﬁciency (HRD) is a frequent feature of high-grade serous ovarian,
fallopian tube and peritoneal carcinoma (HGSC) and is associated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) therapy.
HRD testing provides an opportunity to optimise PARPi use in HGSC but methodologies are diverse and clinical
application remains controversial.
Materials and methods: To deﬁne best practice for HRD testing in HGSC the ESMO Translational Research and Precision
Medicine Working Group launched a collaborative project that incorporated a systematic review approach. The main
aims were to (i) deﬁne the term ‘HRD test’; (ii) provide an overview of the biological rationale and the level of
evidence supporting currently available HRD tests; (iii) provide recommendations on the clinical utility of HRD tests
in clinical management of HGSC.
Results: A broad range of repair genes, genomic scars, mutational signatures and functional assays are associated with a
history of HRD. Currently, the clinical validity of HRD tests in ovarian cancer is best assessed, not in terms of biological
HRD status per se, but in terms of PARPi beneﬁt. Clinical trials evidence supports the use of BRCA mutation testing and
two commercially available assays that also incorporate genomic instability for identifying subgroups of HGSCs that
derive different magnitudes of beneﬁt from PARPi therapy, albeit with some variation by clinical scenario. These
tests can be used to inform treatment selection and scheduling but their use is limited by a failure to consistently
identify a subgroup of patients who derive no beneﬁt from PARPis in most studies. Existing tests lack negative
predictive value and inadequately address the complex and dynamic nature of the HRD phenotype.
Conclusions: Currently available HRD tests are useful for predicting likely magnitude of beneﬁt from PARPis but better
biomarkers are urgently needed to better identify current homologous recombination proﬁciency status and stratify
HGSC management.
Key words: homologous recombination deﬁciency (HRD), poly-ADP ribose inhibitors (PARPi), BRCA, genomic scar assays
INTRODUCTION
Every year, almost 250 000 women worldwide are diag-
nosed with high-grade serous carcinoma of the ovary, fal-
lopian tube or peritoneum (HGSC). Following standard
treatment approaches of cytoreductive surgery and plat-
inum and taxane based chemotherapy the average 5-year
survival rate is approximately 30%.1 Around half of HGSCs

exhibit defects within the homologous recombination DNA
repair pathway and are therefore reliant on more error
prone means of DNA repair such as non-homologous end
joining.2,3 HGSC with homologous recombination repair
deﬁciency (HRD) (see Box 1 for Glossary of terms) exhibit a
distinct clinical phenotype including a superior response to
platinum salt chemotherapies and sensitivity to poly-ADP
ribose inhibitors (PARPi).4,5 The introduction of PARPis has
transformed the management of HGSC in both relapsed and
ﬁrst-line treatment settings.6-13 Developing methods to
reliably determine the HRD status of a HGSC is of critical
importance to optimise clinical beneﬁt from these drugs.
The best characterised causes of HRD in HGSC are
germline or somatic mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2
genes (BRCA) that encode the breast cancer type 1 and type
2 susceptibility proteins and are detected in 12%-15% and
5%-7% of cases, respectively.2,14 However, there is now
clear evidence that HRD can arise through germline and
somatic mutations or methylation of a wider set of ho-
mologous recombination repair (HRR) related genes, or
other as yet undeﬁned mechanisms.3 Furthermore, a range
of mechanisms such as reversion mutations in the BRCA
genes can reinstate homologous recombination proﬁciency
(HRP) revealing that HRD status is both a complex and dy-
namic phenotype.15,16 A wide range of assays, referred to as
‘HRD tests’, have been developed to try to better deﬁne
which cancers, beyond BRCA mutant, are most likely to
have HRD. These HRD tests fall into three main categories:
(i) HRR pathway related genes that identify speciﬁc causes
of HRD, (ii) genomic ‘scars’ or mutational signatures that
measure the patterns of somatic mutations that accumulate
in HRD cancers irrespective of the underlying defect and (iii)
functional assays that have the potential to provide a real-
time read out of HRD or HRP (Figure 1).
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working
Group identiﬁed that there is currently uncertainty within
the oncology community surrounding the different methods
for HRD testing in HGSC. To address this, a collaborative
project was launched with a number of clinicians and sci-
entists with expertise in the ﬁelds of PARPi clinical trials,
cancer genomics and DNA repair. The group deﬁned three
main aims for the project: (i) Deﬁne the term ‘HRD test’ and
recommend how an HRD test’s clinical validity is currently
Box 1. Glossary of Terms
Homologous recombination repair (HRR). A form of DNA recombination often used to repair DNA double strand breaks
(DSBs). HRR predominantly acts in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is a conservative process, restoring the original
DNA sequence at the site of damage. During HRR, part of the DNA sequence around the DSB is removed (resection),
revealing regions of single stranded DNA (ssDNA). The DNA recombinase RAD51 binds ssDNA and invades the DNA
sequence on a homologous sister chromatid, using this as a template for the synthesis of new DNA at the DSB site. Crucial
proteins involved in mediating HRR include those encoded by BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D and PALB2.
Homologous recombination deﬁciency (HRD). A defect in DNA repair by hampered HRR. In cancers, this is often caused
by loss of function mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, RAD51D or PALB2, promoter hypermethylation of the BRCA1
gene promoter (leading to reduced expression of BRCA1) or a series of as yet to be deﬁned causes. HRD can be deﬁned in
multiple ways, for example, by the use of experimental assays that measure the conservative versus non-conservative
repair of DSBs, mutational signatures that are the result of HRD or the inability of cells to relocalise the DNA recom-
binase RAD51 to sites of DNA damage. HRD is also characterised by the cellular sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, topo-
isomerase inhibitors or platinum salts although other causes of sensitivity to these agents also exist, including defects in
nucleotide excision repair (NER) which causes platinum salt sensitivity. The term ‘HRD’ is often used interchangeably with
the term ‘BRCAness’, although this latter term describes a broader concept that describes cancers that share molecular,
histological, clinical and phenotypic features of germline BRCA mutant cancers (gBRCAm phenocopies), including, but not
exclusive to, HRD, sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors and platinum salts.
HRD cancer. Cancers that exhibit HRD. HRD is enriched in cancers of the ovary, prostate, pancreas and breast, where
defects in BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD51D or PALB2 are most prevalent.
Homologous recombination proﬁciency (HRP). The scenario where cells/tumour cells are able to effectively repair DNA
damage by HRR. Often associated with primary or acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors or
platinum salts.
Poly-ADP ribose inhibitors (PARPi). PARPi are small molecule inhibitors of the PARP family of proteins, which play critical
roles in DNA repair through multiple DNA damage response pathways, with HRD cells showing a greater reliance on PARP
activity to maintain cell survival. The ﬁnding that single-agent PARP inhibition selectively killed BRCA-deﬁcient cells was a
key discovery in exploiting synthetic lethal approaches in oncology. PARP inhibitors trap PARP1 protein on to DNA at sites
of single-strand DNA breaks. When this trapped PARP1 is encountered by the DNA replication machinery it leads to
stalling of the replication fork, collapse and the generation of a double strand break, which cannot be repaired in cells
with HRD such as BRCA-mutated cells.

best assessed in the context of HGSC, (ii) provide an over-
view of the biological rationale and the level of evidence
supporting currently available HRD tests, and (iii) provide
recommendations on the clinical utility of HRD tests in
clinical management of HGSC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The expert panel was comprised of oncologists, a geneticist,
pathologist and basic scientists operating in Europe, USA
and Australia (see supplementary Methods, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2102). All panel
members offered expertise in two or more areas relevant to
the topic including but not limited to ovarian cancer man-
agement, DNA repair, cancer genomics, mutational signa-
tures, cancer evolution, functional genomics, clinical trials,
biomarker
development
and
PARPi
development
and
biology. To formally capture a balanced representation of
experts’ opinions on current HRD test usage, challenges and
future opportunities, we employed a questionnaire-based
approach that supplemented regular discussions.
A systematic review-based approach, adhering to the
PRISMA statement pre-set-up protocol, was used as the start-
ing point for identifying studies that combined HRD testing
methodologies with PARPi or platinum chemotherapies
(supplementary Table S1 and supplementary Methods, avail-
able at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2102).17 A
total of 343 relevant records were screened and 68 records
were retained for critical evidence appraisal (supplementary
Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.
08.2102). For each HRD biomarker test shortlisted, studies
were categorised by panel members using the level ofevidence
(LOE) approach and for genomics-based tests using the Evalu-
ation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention
(EGAPP) ranking where appropriate evidence was available
(supplementary Table S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/
j.annonc.2020.08.2102).18,19 The EGAPP approach aims to
determine whether there is direct evidence that using the test
leads to clinically meaningful improvement in outcomes or is
useful in medical or personal decision-making.18,19 To this end,
the agreed deﬁnition for assessing clinical validity of an HRD
test is ‘accuracy of prediction of PARP inhibitor beneﬁt’ (see
supplementary Methods, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/
j.annonc.2020.08.2102, for further details).
Final consensus statements were generated in agreement
by all panel members in light of the evidence review. The
ﬁnal degree of consensus was obtained by the mean per-
centage of agree responses to each statement from the 16
expert panel members (values range from 0%: total
disagreement to 100%: total agreement), was judged as
inconsistent if <60%, low in the range 60%-69%, moderate
in the range 70%-79%, strong from 80% to 89% and very
strong if >90%. The manuscript and consensus statements
were reviewed by the wider ESMO Translational Research
and Precision Medicine Working Group and the Faculty in
Gynaecological Cancers.
RESULTS
Pathological considerations
Concordance between histopathological and molecular
features is essential in cancer, particularly when assessing
somatic alterations in tissues. The recommendations in this
article relate to HGSCs of the ovary, fallopian tube and the
peritoneum that share morphological and molecular fea-
tures. Pathological diagnosis is straightforward in most
cases but can be more challenging in the subgroup with
solid, pseudo-endometrioid or transitional (SET) features,
that like other HGSCs frequently exhibit HRD.20,21 These
tumours were historically classiﬁed as endometrioid or
transitional cell carcinomas, which explains the occurrence
of HRD in some older series of endometrioid carcinomas or
mixed endometrioideserous carcinomas.22,23 The two most
recent WHO classiﬁcations (2014 and 2020)24,25 clearly
state that these tumours are variants of HGSC, and provide
information for distinguishing between HGSC and high-
grade endometrioid carcinomas. A panel of antibodies
(including WT-1, TP53, NAPSIN A and oestrogen and pro-
gesterone receptor) is helpful for conﬁrming diagnosis.26
The pathologist is responsible for controlling the pre-
analytical conditions of tumour tissue samples and is
therefore critical to the success of the range of HRD tests
discussed below. Inappropriate tissue handling (delayed
ﬁxation and over-ﬁxation) may modify the quality of the
sample, impacting on molecular test results. For molecular
tissue-based HRD tests, representative tumour area selec-
tion and assessment of the percentage of malignant cells,
necrosis and inﬂammatory component is of fundamental
importance. Typically, a minimum of 30% tumour compo-
nent is recommended to guarantee the detection of a
variant through molecular techniques. For some cancers
with HRD this can be difﬁcult to achieve due to abundant
inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates.27,28 It is recommended that
molecular laboratories and pathology departments main-
tain quality standards within both pre-analytical and
analytical steps by adhering to national or international
standards, such as ISO 15189 or equivalent.
Consensus recommendation
Pathological evaluation of the tumour tissue specimens
used for assessment of somatic molecular alterations is
essential. It is recommended that a pathologist with expe-
rience in gynaecological pathology should be a member of
the team and responsible for conﬁrming diagnosis, assess-
ing sample adequacy, selection of tumour area, and quan-
tiﬁcation of tumour cells, inﬂammatory cells and necrosis.
An
integrated
pathology-molecular
report
is
highly
recommended.

Deﬁning the HRD test

HRR capacity directly, HRD functional tests are some way off
routine clinical use. The HRD tests that are used in the clinic

or have been tested within published randomised clinical
trials to date measure a genotype (gene mutation/methyl-
ation or genomic scar) that correlates with an HRD
phenotype and deﬁcient HRR but not HRR itself. The ma-
jority of HRD tests currently under investigation are being
developed to identify patients who beneﬁt from PARPi and
therefore will only indirectly identify cancers with HRD
(Figure 2A). As discussed below, currently an HRD test result
is most likely to have clinical utility in the context of PARPi
treatment stratiﬁcation and therefore PARPi beneﬁt is the
preferred outcome against which HRD test performance
should be measured (Figure 2B). This underlies the decision
to focus this recommendation article on the methods of
HRD testing to guide PARPi therapy rather than their ability
to detect HRD per se. It is important, however, to recognise
that this may limit the future utility of these tests, partic-
ularly when considering other inhibitors of key targets
involved in the DNA repair.
Methods for detecting HRD in HGSC
The systematic review conﬁrmed that the currently available
HRD testing methods fall into three main categories: HRR
gene level tests, genomic scars and signatures and functional
assays (Figure 1). The critical evidence review for individual
tests is summarised in Table 1 with an LOE and EGAPP ranking
provided for each test where relevant (see supplementary
Tables
S4-S10,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.
annonc.2020.08.2102, for details for each test category).
The main evidence supporting (or refuting) the clinical val-
idity and clinical utility of these tests is derived from eight
pivotal randomised controlled trials that are summarised in
Table 2. A comparison of the hazard ratios within the inten-
tion to treat and the mainly exploratory HRD test driven
subgroup analyses are presented in Figure 3. For additional
comments from the expert panel on methods of HRD testing

HRR gene level tests
Germline mutations in BRCA genes. Germline (inherited)
BRCA1 and BRCA2 (gBRCA) mutations are implicated in the
development of 13%-15% of HGSC.2,14 Functional BRCA1
and BRCA2 proteins are crucial to the repair of double-
stranded DNA breaks by HRR.29 Cancers that arise in in-
dividuals with a deleterious gBRCA mutation frequently
harbour a somatic loss of function aberration in the cor-
responding wild-type BRCA allele and therefore have
defective HRR. The development of PARP inhibitors as
treatment of HGSC was prompted by observations that
BRCA mutations greatly increased the in-vitro sensitivity of
cancer cells to PARP inhibition.30,31
Across the main randomised clinical trials in both ﬁrst-
line and relapse maintenance settings, whether as mono-
therapy or as combination therapy, a common theme is
observeddBRCA mutation status consistently identiﬁes the
subgroup of patients who derive the greatest beneﬁt from
PARPi treatment in platinum-sensitive disease (LOE 1,
Tables 1 and 2, Figure 3).6-8,10-13,32 Despite some differences
in trial design, patient characteristics and the treatment
setting, the hazard ratio (HR) for PARPi maintenance
therapy beneﬁt in patients with a BRCA mutation is
remarkably similar between all the above trials suggesting a
robustness of the biomarker as a positive predictor of
response (Figure 3). However, the negative predictive value
(NPV) of BRCA mutation status is universally poor in the
setting of platinum-sensitive relapsed HGSC, with BRCA
wild-type (BRCAwt) subgroups also deriving a signiﬁcant,
although numerically smaller beneﬁt from PARPi (Table 2,
Figure 3).7,10,12 Similarly, in the ﬁrst-line setting PARPi
treatment beneﬁt extended to patients without BRCA mu-
tations, which probably reﬂects the fact that platinum

Somatic BRCA mutations. An additional 5%-7% of HGSC
harbour somatic BRCA (sBRCA) mutations that have arisen
during cancer development or progression.2 While many
studies utilised tumour BRCA (tBRCA) status (incorporating
both gBRCA and sBRCA) as a biomarker to determine PARPi
beneﬁt,7,13,32 data on sBRCA mutations alone is more
limited. Retrospective analysis from Study 19 identiﬁed
sBRCA mutation in 10% of patients.33 There was bi-allelic

evaluation of genomic applications in practice and prevention (EGAPP) ranking17 is provided. For EGAPP ranking, clinical validity is deﬁned as ‘accuracy of prediction of PARP
inhibitor sensitivity’ and clinical utility describes the ‘accuracy of prediction of PARP inhibitor beneﬁt’ in the ﬁrst-line and platinum-sensitive relapsed maintenance settings. Clinical
utility is reported as good, fair, or marginal, where marginal reﬂects the fact that the studies may not have been poor in general but may not have been designed to address the
speciﬁc question. LOE and EGAPP ranking is designed to evaluate genomic (not functional) tests and is only provided for HRD tests for which there is sufﬁcient clinical evidence to
evaluate. Tumour BRCA incorporates both germline (inherited) BRCA and somatic (acquired) BRCA mutations.

inactivation in >80% of cases and mutations were pre-
dominantly clonal, suggesting that sBRCA mutations arise
early in tumourigenesis. The clinical outcomes for patients
with sBRCA mutations were similar to those with gBRCA
mutations in terms of progression-free survival (PFS, HR
0.23 versus 0.17, respectively). Within the NOVA trial, 47 (of
553) patients harboured an sBRCA mutation and derived a
similar beneﬁt from niraparib compared with placebo (PFS
increase 11 to 20.9 months, HR 0.27) as the gBRCA popu-
lation (PFS 5.5. to 21.0 months, HR 0.27).10 Similarly, for
rucaparib, data are available for monotherapy treatment in
patients with platinum-sensitive advanced disease; for 19
patients with sBRCA mutation the response rate was 74%
which was similar to those with gBRCA mutations (85%) and
PFS was also similar.34 Finally, within the VELIA ﬁrst-line
study, a similar beneﬁt was observed for gBRCA (HR 0.5,
0.30-0.82) and sBRCA (HR 0.35, 0.14-0.87) with veliparib

respectively. Similar trends are seen across trials with incremental PARPi beneﬁt across HRD and homologous recombination proﬁcient (HRP) subgroups. The greatest
beneﬁt is observed in the BRCA mutation cohort (s, t and g preﬁx ¼ somatic, tumour and germline, respectively) (dark purple), followed by those with high genomic
instability scores (GIS), loss of heterozygosity (LOH) scores or a BRCA mutation (medium purple) (these are equivalent to the Myriad Genetics and Foundation medicine
commercial assay ‘HRD positive’ subgroups), the BRCAwt group with GIS/LOH-high (light purple) and ﬁnally the HRP BRCAwt (dark green) and the BRCAwt/GIS/LOH-low

30% of HGSC.2 Clinical studies have demonstrated that so-
matic mutations in non-BRCA HRR genes confer a PFS and
overall survival advantage, similar to that seen with BRCA
mutations in patients treated with platinum chemotherapy,
when compared with patients who have neither a BRCA nor
HRR mutation.4 However, due to the relative rarity of non-
BRCA HRR mutations, these studies grouped all HRR genes
together while other data on individual HRR genes is
anecdotal which makes it difﬁcult to interpret the relevance
of any individual HRR gene at present. Indeed, emerging
evidence reveals that mutations in different HRR genes,
such as ATM and BRCA, can be associated with distinct
sensitivities to PARPi40 and a one-size-ﬁts-all approach
when using HRR mutations to predict PARPi response
should be avoided.
In a retrospective analysis from Study 19, tumour tissue
testing identiﬁed that 21 HGSCs without BRCA mutations
had mutations in other genes implicated in DNA repair
including BRIP1 (BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal heli-
case 1) that co-operates with BRCA1 to perform DNA repair.
Other DNA repair genes altered in more than one patient
included CDK12, RAD54L and RAD51B.41 The cohort of
HGSC that lacked a BRCA mutation but carried a mutation in
other HRR genes derived a similar beneﬁt to those with a
BRCA mutation (HR 0.21 and HR 0.18, respectively) and this
was of a greater magnitude to that observed in the cohort
that lacked mutations in either BRCA or the wider set of
HRR genes (HR 0.71).41 Caution is required in interpreting
the data from this retrospective analysis, as the numbers of
patients with defects in any one gene (other than BRCA1 or
BRCA2) are small and a similarly sized study could generate
a different set of recurrently altered HRR genes. Within the
ARIEL2
(NCT01891344)
rucaparib
monotherapy
study,
exploratory analysis was carried out on 12 patients with
pre-treatment and post-progression biopsies.42 Two pa-
tients had a mutation in a non-BRCA HRR gene (RAD51C
and RAD51D) with both patients deriving clinical beneﬁt to
rucaparib treatment. Interestingly, both post-progression
biopsy samples contained reversion mutations that were
predicted to restore the respective gene functions, which
was conﬁrmed in vitro.
Variants of uncertain signiﬁcance
Not all mutations falling within the BRCA or other HRR
genes alter protein function or contribute towards cancer
development. A major challenge for BRCA and wider HRR
gene testing is determining the clinical relevance of variants
of uncertain signiﬁcance (VUS) that are typically rarer
missense mutations and also include intronic or exonic
mutations that may alter RNA splicing.43-45 The biological
relevance of variants that lead to partial or ‘leaky’ splicing
defects, particularly in BRCA2, that reduce full length tran-
script production are particularly hard to interpret.46 The
problem of VUS is even more pronounced for wider gene
panel tests where the functional and clinical consequences
of most individual genomic loci are not well characterised
and individual mutations are not highly recurrent. Further-
more, somatic VUS may be more numerous and diverse
than germline variants as they may arise in the context of
an elevated mutation rate and/or genomic instability that is
characteristic of many cancers.47
A
recent
international
questionnaire-based
study
revealed surprising variation between individual labora-
tories worldwide, in the rate of BRCA VUS detection/
reporting (3%-50%) and in the approaches used for detec-
tion, reporting and clinical management of patients with a
VUS.48 This reﬂects the challenges in VUS annotation and is
the subject of an existing ESMO publication.49 Given the
difﬁculty of predicting the functional relevance of an indi-
vidual point mutation or structural variant within a given
gene footprint, corroborating evidence of HRD from a
genomic mutation/scar test and/or a functional assay, as
discussed below, would ideally be acquired.
HR gene promoter methylation
Although the impact of deleterious BRCA gene mutations
on PARPi and platinum responses in HGSC is established,
the clinical relevance of HRR gene promoter methylation is
more difﬁcult to interpret.50-54 There is biological evidence
that BRCA1 and RAD51C gene promoter methylation can
result in HRD. Promoter methylation results in reduced
expression of these key HRR genes, and in cancers it is
generally mutually exclusive with BRCA mutation2,52,55-57
and positively associated with BRCA-deﬁciency associated
genomic signatures.56,58 However, clinical studies that
included screening for HRR gene methylation provide con-
ﬂicting evidence and its accuracy and reliability as a
biomarker for predicting PARPi (or platinum) responses in
HGSC patients cannot currently be established.2,34,52,54,59,60
There is now evidence to suggest that existing studies
were confounded by technical factors associated with the
measurement of tumour DNA methylation.52-54 It was only
recently discovered, using cohort HGSC patient-derived
xenograft models, that the zygosity of BRCA1 methylation
is a key determining factor for PARPi response.61 Kondra-
shova et al. demonstrated that all copies of BRCA1 must be
methylated for PARPi response and that losing methylation
of a single BRCA1 copy was sufﬁcient to restore HRR DNA
repair and cause platinum/PARPi resistance.61 This ﬁnding
was validated using BRCA1 samples from the ARIEL2 Part 1
trial, where ‘homozygous’ BRCA1 methylation was carefully
assigned
using
highly quantitative methylation-speciﬁc
droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (to mea-
sure BRCA1 methylation), as well as sample/tumour purity
and BRCA1 copy number estimates.61 Although the same
principles of methylation zygosity may apply to RAD51C
methylated cases, this remains to be conﬁrmed. Thus, in
future, great caution should be taken in assigning methyl-
ation
status
to
these
HRR
genes,
with
quantitative
methylation assays, sample purity and gene copy number
all being critical for accurate HRD assessment and predicting
platinum/PARPi responses.

Consensus statements on HRR gene tests
 BRCA mutation tests [germline (LOE I), tumour (incorpo-
rating germline and somatic) (LOE I) and somatic (LOE I/
II)] exhibit good clinical validity by consistently identifying
the subgroup of ovarian cancer patients who derive the
greatest magnitude of beneﬁt from PARPi therapy.
(Level of agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
 There is currently an insufﬁcient quantity of evidence to
determine the clinical validity of individual or panels of
non-BRCA HRR genes for predicting a PARPi response
and further prospectively collected data is required
(LOE II).
(Level of agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
 There is currently insufﬁcient evidence to determine the
clinical validity of BRCA1 or RAD51C promoter methyl-
ation to predict PARPi beneﬁt, partly due to concerns
regarding the analytic validity of previous studies.
(Level of agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
GENOMIC SIGNATURES AND SCARS
Cancers and cell lines with BRCA mutations exhibit genomic
instability, manifesting in abnormal copy number proﬁles
and thousands of somatic mutations genome-wide that
include both single base substitutions (SBS) and structural
variants (SVs) that are characterised by a preponderance of
short deletions (1 bp to 100 kbp) and short tandem dupli-
cations (up to 10 kbp) (Figure 1). Measuring some or all of
these genomic features provide ways of identifying cancers
with a history of HRD, irrespective of the underlying
aetiology.
Copy number based ‘scar’ assays
Most HRDgenomic assaysin currentuse weredeveloped using
SNP-based microarray technologiesand measure somatic copy
number variation (CNV). In 2012 three studies reported SNP-
based CNV assays that predicted BRCA status through the
quantiﬁcation of large scale transitions (LST),62 loss of het-
erozygosity (LOH)63 or number of subchromosomal regions
with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere64 NtAI
(Figure 1). Subsequent studies suggested that combining the
information derived from two or more of these assays further
enhanced the ability to distinguish between HRR competent
and deﬁcient cancers.65 The most common genomic scar as-
says reported to date are two commercially available tests that
combine tumour BRCA mutation testing with a genomic
instability score derived from the unweighted sum of NtAI, LST
and LOH (myChoice HRD test, Myriad Genetics) or with an
assessment of fraction of genomic sub-chromosomal LOH66
(FoundationFocus
CDxBRCA,
Foundation
Medicine)67
(Figure 1). The Myriad genomic instability score (GIS) uses a
dichotomousthreshold,determinedwithina trainingcohortof
497 breast and 461 ovarian cancers, including 268 BRCA
mutant or promoter methylated tumours to classify cancers as
GIS-high or GIS-low.66 The LOH test uses a next generation
sequencing assay to determine the percentage of genomic
LOH. A predeﬁned cut-off of 14% or more deﬁnes LOH-high,
based on the TCGA data.2 As discussed below, both GIS and
LOH tests were developed with predeﬁned thresholds but
these were not adopted in all studies.The biomarker potential
of LOH-high versus LOH-low and the MyChoice assay have
been investigated in high quality (LOE I) prospective clinical
trialsofPARPis inthe ﬁrst-line and/orrelapse settings (Tables 1
and 2).6-8,10,12,13,34
Only the monotherapy ARIEL2 trial was designed to eval-
uate genomic scarring within the BRCAwt population. All of
the maintenance studies in both the primary and recurrent
setting completed to date which have included genomic
instability as molecular assay used a nested approach for the
primary outcomes in which the HRD population included
BRCA-mutated HGSC (Table 2). Therefore, evaluating the
utility of LOH or GIS to predict beneﬁt from PARPi in the
BRCAwt populations were preplanned secondary analyses
that were not adequately powered to allow deﬁnitive ana-
lyses in any of the large randomised controlled trials. The
strongest evidence for LOH status as a marker of PARPi
response is derived from the ARIEL studies of rucaparib. The
ARIEL2 (part 1) phase II monotherapy studyclassiﬁed patients
into three predeﬁned subgroups according to HRD status:
BRCA mutant; BRCAwt/LOH-high and HRP (BRCAwt/LOH-
low).34 Amongst patients with BRCAwt cancers, PFS was su-
perior in the LOH-high compared with the LOH-low subgroup
(0.62, 0.42-0.90, P ¼ 0.011). Because ARIEL2 is a mono-
therapy study without a control arm, it is possible that LOH
status functioned as a prognostic not predictive marker. In the
phase III ARIEL3 study of rucaparib versus placebo as main-
tenance therapy in relapsed disease, the primary endpoint of
PFS was further explored within prespeciﬁed HRD categories
including BRCAwt/LOH-high and BRCAwt with LOH-low
(HRP), but these analyses were limited by lack of LOH sta-
tus as a stratiﬁcation factor and inadequate power for such
secondary comparisons (Table 2). The threshold for deter-
mining LOH status (16%) also differed to that determined in
the original studies (14%).34 Treatment beneﬁt (PFS) was
greatest in BRCA mutant (HR 0.23, 0.16-0.39), followed by
HRD positive (BRCA mutant or LOH-high; HR 0.32, 0.24-0.42),
BRCAwt/LOH-high (HR 0.44, 0.29-0.66) and ﬁnally the HRP
(BRCAwt and LOH-low) cohort (HR 0.58, 0.4-0.8)7 (Figure 3).
The NOVA study of niraparib versus placebo included two
parallel cohorts: gBRCA mutant and BRCAwt. A hierarchical
analysis was carried out within the BRCAwt group for the
GIS-high and then all gBRCAwt subgroups. GIS was not a
stratiﬁcation factor.10 Findings echoed those of ARIEL3,
including an intermediate beneﬁt in the BRCAwt/GIS-high
and failure to identify an HRP group who do not beneﬁt
(Table 2). A retrospective analysis of Study 19, combined
with GIS testing further conﬁrmed that GIS did moderately
separate the BRCAwt population into higher and lower
beneﬁt groups but does not adequately deﬁne an HRP
group who derive no beneﬁt from a PARPi.41 In the relapse
platinum-sensitive setting the LOH score and GIS score
therefore demonstrate good clinical validity in their ability
to deﬁne a BRCAwt subgroup that derive a greater beneﬁt
from PARPi. However, the clinical utility of these tests, at
least in the platinum-sensitive setting, as discussed in the
R. E. Miller et al.

next section, is limited by the fact that neither test can
consistently identify a BRCAwt subgroup that derives no
beneﬁt from PARPi (Table 1, Figure 2A). There have been no
side-by-side comparisons of these tests within clinical trials
to draw a direct comparison of performance.
GIS is the only genomic scar assay that has been tested to
date in ﬁrst-line randomised controlled trials (Table 2). The
PRIMA study compared niraparib to placebo and stratiﬁed
treatment according to HRD status (combined tBRCA status
and GIS score) in patients with documented platinum-
responsive disease after primary treatment.8 Like ARIEL3 and
NOVA, analyses of GIS within the BRCAwt population was a
preplanned exploratory analysis in PRIMA. Possibly reﬂecting
the stringent platinum responsiveness inclusion criteria
(including at least 90% reduction in serum CA125), the results
were similar to those seen in the relapse setting with beneﬁt
observed in all BRCAwt HGSC irrespective of GIS, although the
magnitude of beneﬁt was higher in the GIS-high compared
with GIS-low subgroup (HR 0.5, 0.31-0.83 versus HR 0.68, 0.49-
0.94) (Table 2, Figure 3). In contrast to PRIMA, in the VELIA
study, veliparib or placebo was given concurrently with
chemotherapy as well as maintenance therapy. However, this
study was not designed or powered to detect a difference
within the BRCAwt population so we do not know how to
interpret the fact that the GIS-high subgroup (deﬁned in this
study as a score 33) appears to derive almost identical
beneﬁtto the overall BRCAwtcohort (HR 0.81, 0.6-1.09and HR
0.8, 0.64-1.0, respectively), which could reﬂect the lack of se-
lection for platinum sensitivity or the utilisation of PARPi in
combination with chemotherapy before maintenance.6 The
PAOLA-1 study investigated the beneﬁt of adding olaparib to
bevacizumab maintenance therapy.13 Amongst BRCAwt HGSC,
PARPi beneﬁt was restricted to those with a high GIS (HR 0.43,
0.28-0.66 versus HR 0.92, 0.72-1.17 with low GIS) indicating
that in some patient populations the GIS has the potential to
identify an HRP population who do not derive beneﬁt from
PARPi, when given in combination with bevacizumab.
Mutational signatures
Whole genome sequencing of a typical cancer will reveal
thousands of somatic mutations. The pattern of mutations
reﬂects historical endogenous and exogenous mutational
processes that have operated in the cell. Each mutational
process may contain components of DNA damage, repair
and replication and can generate a characteristic mutational
signature that can be detected using computational meth-
odologies.68,69 In HGSC, mutational signatures have been
shown to correlate with clinical features such as survival
and platinum response.69-73
The most commonly cited approach for detecting point
mutational signatures was developed by Alexandrov et al.68
Every SBS in the genome is ﬁrst assigned to one of 96 possi-
bilities determined by the base change (C>A, C>G, C>T,
T>A, T>C, T>G) and the immediate 50 and 30 base. Muta-
tional signatures are then extracted using a non-negative
matrix factorisation (NMF) method. Applying this approach
to over 2600 cancers has identiﬁed a total of 49 distinct SBS
mutational signatures to date.47 SBS Signature 3 is associated
with BRCA mutation and BRCA1 promoter methylation in
breast, ovarian, pancreatic and stomach cancers. It has been
proposed as a biomarker for HRD.74 However, in isolation SBS
Signature 3 is unlikely to provide a sufﬁciently robust clinical
biomarker for guiding PARPi therapy in HGSC. Firstly, it
probably lacks speciﬁcity (the vast majority of HGSCs have
some contribution from Signature 3). Secondly, ascertaining
appropriate thresholds will be difﬁcult as the relatively
indistinct nature of the signature makes it particularly sen-
sitive to a reduction in the number of mutationsthat occurs in
low tumour cellularity or when swamped by other competing
mutational signatures.75
As HRD causes different types of genomic alterations, an
assay that utilises as much genome-wide information as
possible is likely to offer greater speciﬁcity and sensitivity. A
BRCA deﬁciency detector termed HRDetect75 was developed
using whole genome sequence data from BRCA mutant and
wild-type (control) breast cancer samples. The algorithm uses
information from all four mutation classes and measures six
genomic features that are assigned different weightings as
speciﬁed in brackets: (i) Indels, microhomology mediated de-
letions (2.398); (ii) SBSs, Signature 3 (1.611) and Signature 8
(0.091);(iii)SVs,rearrangementSignature3[mainlyshort(<10
kb)tandem duplications](1.153)and rearrangement Signature
5 (deletions of <100 kb)(0.847); (iv) CNV, the HRD score (as
used in Myriad myChoice HRD) (0.667). Using a probabilistic
cut-off of 70%, HRDetect predicted BRCA deﬁciency with a
sensitivity of 98.7% in 560 breast cancers (including the
training cohort), 86% in a validation breast cancer cohort (n ¼
80) and approaching 100% in ovarian cancer (n ¼ 73) and
pancreatic cancer (n ¼ 96) validation cohorts. Cases with
monoallelic BRCA loss had low HRDetect scores.The HRDetect
assay signiﬁcantly outperformed existing genomic scar mea-
sures such as the GIS that had a sensitivity of 60%.66 In breast
cancer, there is some evidence that the HRDetect score can
predict clinical outcome and response to platinum therapy
(AUC 0.89, P ¼ 0.006) but its ability to predict PARPi beneﬁt in
HGSC has not yet been established.76,77
There is strong pre-clinical evidence that mutation-based
assays that use information from multiple mutation types
could outperform existing scar assays. A major limitation,
however, is the reliance on fresh frozen material while most
trial samples are formalin ﬁxed parafﬁn embedded (FFPE).
While FFPE-related artefacts can be managed with relative
ease in targeted sequencing experiments, in whole genome
data, although some solutions have been developed, these
artefacts remain challenging.78 A second limitation of all
genomic scar or signature assays is that they by deﬁnition
reﬂect the historical existence of HRD and do not provide in-
formation about current HRP status that can be reinstated
through different mechanisms.

Functional assays
Functional assays have the potential to provide a dynamic
readout of actual, extant, HRR status. The most commonly-
used experimental system to estimate HRR has been to
estimate the amount of nuclear RAD51, a downstream HR
protein (a DNA recombinase) that enables high-ﬁdelity
double strand DNA repair by facilitating DNA strand inva-
sion into the sister chromatid, a process supported by the
BRCA1/PALB2/BRCA2 complex. Reduced DNA damaged-
induced nuclear RAD51 foci has been associated with
BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene defects as well as PARPi responses,
both in ovarian and breast cancer laboratory models and in
small cohorts of patient samples, including ex-vivo cultures
derived from ascites or from solid HGSC.79,80 Further evi-
dence exists in breast cancer where low RAD51 foci
(induced by DNA-damaging chemotherapy) are associated
with patient treatment responses to neoadjuvant chemo-
therapy or to PARPi.81-83 Two limitations of measuring
reduced RAD51 as a surrogate of HRD are (i) the RAD51
assay will not identify defects in HR downstream of RAD51
loading on to DNA and (ii) when used experimentally, the
RAD51 signal is normally elicited by exogenous DNA dam-
age, limiting the clinical applicability of the approach.
However, the ability to estimate nuclear RAD51 levels in the
absence of exogenous damage as an estimate of HRD has
now been demonstrated in treatment naive, archival FFPE
tumour specimens, suggesting that clinical application of
this assay might be possible.84 Retrospective analyses of
larger clinical cohorts are also needed to demonstrate the
clinical validity of the RAD51 assay. Prospective trials
selecting patients according to their RAD51 score are also
awaited.
Consensus statement on the use of functional assays of
HRD
 There is currently insufﬁcient evidence to ascertain the
clinical validity of functional assays in predicting response
to PARPi therapies, but these pre-clinical assays provide
promise for ascertaining real-time estimates of HRD and
their development should be a priority. The potential for
using functional assays alongside HRR gene tests and
genomic tests should be investigated.

CLINICAL UTILITY OF AVAILABLE HRD TESTS
PARPis are licensed by European Medicines Agency (EMA)
and/or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use
in three clinical settings in the management of HGSCs: (i) as
ﬁrst-line
maintenance
therapy
for
platinum-sensitive,
advanced stage cancers, (ii) as second-line maintenance
therapy in platinum-sensitive, relapsed disease irrespective
of BRCA mutation or other HRD test deﬁned status and (iii)
as monotherapy treatment in BRCA mutant (olaparib/
rucaparib) or HRD test positive (niraparib) HGSC beyond
two prior lines of therapy. There is some variation in speciﬁc
license details as summarised in Table 3. Notably, EMA but
not FDA regulations limit PARPi use to high-grade cancers
while FDA approvals depend on the use of FDA approved
companion diagnostics for HRD status testing including for
BRCA mutations. Clinical trials evidence has informed recent
approvals by the FDA for ﬁrst-line maintenance therapy,
with EMA approvals awaited (Table 3). Based on the PRIMA
trial data, in April 2020 the FDA approved the use of nir-
aparib for ‘all comers’ based on positive data in the inten-
tion to treat populations.85 Following PAOLA-1 trial data the
FDA extended approval for olaparib beyond BRCA mutation
to those with BRCAwt/GIS-positive HGSC but only when
given in combination with bevacizumab.86 The Myriad
myChoice assay was concurrently approved as a companion
diagnostic for olaparib in this setting.86
Maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapse
In the platinum-sensitive relapsed setting initial approvals
for PARPi maintenance were limited to olaparib for use in
ovarian cancers with BRCA mutations.87,88 Subsequent data
identiﬁed beneﬁt in all subgroups and supported an
extended scope for PARP inhibitor use. This is reﬂected in
approvals by the FDA and EMA for niraparib, rucaparib and
olaparib as maintenance therapy for all patients with
platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, irrespective of
BRCA or HRD status.87-91 However, despite regulatory
approval for ‘all comers’, as discussed in relation to indi-
vidual tests above, there is an incremental reduction in
beneﬁt observed from the BRCA mutant to HRD to HRP
populations as deﬁned by GIS/LOH score assays in main-
tenance monotherapy. The clinical utility of HRD tests (BRCA
mutation and genomic ‘HRD’ scars) in these settings
therefore results from the magnitude of PARPi beneﬁt. The
expert panel commented that in the relapsed setting this
can be helpful for deciding whether to initiate chemo-
therapy and bevacizumab or chemotherapy alone with the
intention of using a PARPi if there is a partial or complete
response. Furthermore, it identiﬁes the group of patients
predicted to derive the least beneﬁt from PARPi mainte-
nance and where clinical trials may be more appropriate.

Maintenance therapy after response to ﬁrst-line
chemotherapy
The
use
of
olaparib
maintenance
following
ﬁrst-line
chemotherapy in patients with advanced BRCA-mutated
HGSC signiﬁcantly improves PFS.11 Within the recent
studies exploring the role of ﬁrst-line PARPi maintenance in
‘all comers’, BRCAwt but HRD positive (i.e. high GIS on
Myriad myChoice HRD) cancers constituted 20%-30% of
HGSC. In two of these trials, preplanned, but exploratory
analyses of this subgroup demonstrated a clinically mean-
ingful increase in median PFS (of greater than 10 months in
each study) from ﬁrst-line PARP inhibition, although the
magnitude of beneﬁt was less than that observed for pa-
tients with BRCA mutant HGSC6,8,13 (Table 2).
The non-HRD (GIS-low and BRCAwt) subgroup consti-
tuted up to 50% of all HGSC in these trials.6,8,13 A more
difﬁcult question to answer is whether existing HRD tests
can consistently identify a group of patients who do not
derive sufﬁcient beneﬁt to justify PARPi therapy in this
setting. No trial was powered to determine whether the
HRP population by itself derived beneﬁt from maintenance
PARPi in either the recurrent or primary setting but all
showed beneﬁt across the intention to treat populations.
The expert panel commented that translating these data
into clinical practice is somewhat challenging due to funda-
mental differences in study design and patient inclusion.The
PAOLA-1 study randomly assigned patients to olaparib with
bevacizumab or bevacizumab with placebo maintenance
therapy (Table 2). Academic research on PAOLA-1 samples
should help to unpick which patients beneﬁt from PARPi plus
bevacizumab but unfortunately itdid not include a PARPi only
maintenance arm, so this question will remain unanswered.
The expert panel advises that caution is required when
evaluating these biomarkers as none of these trials was
prospectively designed to evaluate the HRD test in all sub-
groups, including the HRP population. Indeed, PAOLA-1 was
stratiﬁed for BRCA mutant versus BRCAwt, while BRCAwt/
HRD positive was an exploratory analysis. PRIMA was strati-
ﬁed for HRD positive versus HRP and unknown HRD status
combined. In all three studies, HRP cohort was an exploratory
endpoint.The Myriad myChoice assay was the only one used
in these studies.

Monotherapy treatment with PARPi
There are limited opportunities to use a PARPi as a single-
agent treatment in both Europe and the USA and each
indication requires either a BRCA mutation or HRD positive
cancer (Myriad myChoice) (Table 3).87,88,90-92 Recent data
from the SOLO3 trial suggest that for PARPi naive gBRCA
patients
with
platinum-resistant
or
partially
sensitive
ovarian
cancer,
olaparib
is
superior
to
nonplatinum
chemotherapy with higher response rate and PFS.93 How-
ever, as PARPi maintenance therapy is now routinely
available for all patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed
disease and for all BRCA mutant patients in the ﬁrst-line
setting
the
opportunities
for
monotherapy
use
are
increasingly limited.
Consensus recommendations on the clinical utility of HRD
tests
 In the ﬁrst-line maintenance setting, germline and so-
matic BRCA mutation testing is routinely recommended
to identify HGSC patients who should receive a PARPi.
(Level of agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
 In the ﬁrst-line maintenance setting, it is reasonable to
use a validated scar based HRD test to establish the
magnitude of beneﬁt conferred by PARPi use in BRCA
wild-type HGSC.
(Level of agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
 In the ﬁrst-line maintenance setting, it is reasonable to
use a validated scar based HRD test to identify the sub-
group of BRCA wild-type patients who are least likely to
beneﬁt from PARPi therapy.
(Level of agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
 In the platinum-sensitive relapse maintenance setting, it
is reasonable to use BRCA mutation testing and validated
scar based HRD tests to predict the likely magnitude of
PARPi beneﬁt for consideration of risks and beneﬁts of
maintenance therapy.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES: DEVELOPING THE OPTIMAL HRD
BIOMARKER
Cancer’s capacity to continuously evolve and change is a
common challenge in the era of precision medicine. The
HRD assays currently available in clinical practice do not
provide a dynamic readout and are only valid for the time
point at which the sample is obtained. In reality, the tested
sample is usually archival, typically obtained at diagnosis or
surgical debulking. If an HRD test is to be used to guide
treatment at relapse or in the maintenance setting it ideally
should be carried out on a sample obtained at that point in
time. Successful strategies would therefore need to tackle
the associated problems of minimal residual disease and
inter-tumour heterogeneity (at any point in time there may
be multiple cancer subclones present). So-called liquid bi-
opsies that sample circulating tumour cells, circulating
tumour DNA or ascitic ﬂuid may offer hope for addressing
these problems. There are some promising data from
prostate cancer that demonstrated the utility of ctDNA for
identifying BRCA mutations and reversion mutations and
their correlation to prostate speciﬁc antigen level94 but
clearly more nuanced HRD testing methodologies have not
been explored in this way.
A second challenge is that all of the gene based and
genomic assays, by deﬁnition, provide information on mu-
tations acquired in the past. The footprints from mutational
processes active early in tumourigenesis may not reﬂect
contemporaneous activity of DNA repair mechanisms.
Genomic scars will be detected within relapsed tumours
even if they have developed treatment resistance. Impor-
tantly, at present, none of the DNA sequencing approaches
assess the presence of the known mechanism of clinical
resistance, namely HR gene reversion. It seems logical that
the known reversion events should be included in genomic
assays and further research is needed to elucidate the full
range of mechanisms of clinical resistance. Another route to
tackling this problem might be measuring changes in sub-
clone speciﬁc mutational signatures across serial samples. It
remains that, based on the biology of the disease, we
cannot rely on any of the existing tests to accurately predict
whether HRD is extant at the time of treatment or not. It is
highly likely that some form of functional assay will be
required for this, probably in combination with other HRD
tests.
An additional consideration for current HRD assays is the
need to combine them with other predictive biomarkers as
PARPi therapy evolves to include combination therapy with
other agents such anti-angiogenesis, checkpoint inhibitors
and other DNA repair inhibitors (reviewed in Pilie et al.95).
Further validation using adequately powered clinical trials
either prospectively or retrospectively will be required for
each combination as these develop.
Consensus recommendation
 An optimised HRD biomarker needs to be developed to
address the problem of cancer evolution, provide a real-
time read out of HRP and should ideally generate data in
a format that permits on-going research. (Level of
agreement ¼ 100%; total agreement)
CONCLUSION
We predict that the development of composite biomarkers
will improve treatment stratiﬁcation and these should be a
priority for translational research. Indeed, the likely impact
of platinum sensitivity (itself a strong biomarker of HRD) on
the heterogeneity of HRD-related outcomes in the clinical
trials discussed above indicates that we need to develop
systematic ways to integrate this clinical information with
HRD test results. Real-time composite markers may include
a combination of a platinum sensitivity, genomic scar/
mutational signature test and a functional assay to provide
both robust historical evidence of HRD and to estimate

current HRR capacity. Alternatively, (or within this strategy)
comprehensive genomic assays, based on high quality
whole genome sequencing data, could be developed to
provide simultaneous read outs of HRR gene mutations,
mutational signatures and reversion mutations. Further-
more, if combined with multi-sampling strategies to obtain
contemporaneous and representative tumour tissue sam-
ples, these assays have the potential to trace changes in
subclone structure over a disease course. Given the signif-
icant rate of HRD in other gynaecological histologies and
other cancers including those of the breast, prostate and
pancreas, investing in the development of optimised
biomarker strategies could have far reaching implications.
