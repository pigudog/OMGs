Definitions

CORE elements
CORE elements are those which are essential for the clinical management, staging or prognosis
of the cancer. These elements will either have evidentiary support at Level III-2 or above
(based on prognostic factors in the National Health and Medical Research Council levels of
evidence1). In rare circumstances, where level III-2 evidence is not available an element may be
made a CORE element where there is unanimous agreement in the expert committee. An
appropriate staging system e.g., Pathological TNM staging would normally be included as a
CORE element.

The summation of all CORE elements is considered to be the minimum reporting standard for a
specific cancer.

NON-CORE elements

NON-CORE elements are those which are unanimously agreed should be included in the
dataset but are not supported by level III-2 evidence. These elements may be clinically
important and recommended as good practice but are not yet validated or regularly used in
patient management.

Key information other than that which is essential for clinical management, staging or
prognosis of the cancer such as macroscopic observations and interpretation, which are
fundamental to the histological diagnosis and conclusion e.g., macroscopic tumour details,
may be included as either CORE or NON-CORE elements by consensus of the Dataset Authoring
Committee.

Scope

The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of primary borderline and
malignant epithelial tumours of the ovary, fallopian tubes and peritoneum. It does not include non-epithelial
ovarian neoplasms such as germ cell or sex cord stromal tumours or other primary peritoneal neoplasms such
as mesothelioma.2 In those rare cases where more than one primary tumour of different morphological types
is present, separate datasets should be completed for each neoplasm. These should include all the elements in
this dataset, except for lymph node status which does not need to be documented separately for each tumour.

The 2nd edition of this dataset includes changes to align the dataset with the World Health Organization (WHO)
Classification of Tumours, Female Genital Tumours, 5th edition, 2020.3 The International Collaboration on
Cancer Reporting (ICCR) dataset includes 5th edition Corrigenda, June 2021.4

Note 1 – Clinical information (Non-core)

It is estimated that approximately 10% of primary tubo-ovarian and peritoneal carcinomas have a genetic
basis,5 and this figure may be as high as 17% for high grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs).6 Germline mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of genetically related cases while up to 10% of patients with Lynch
syndrome (LS) will develop ovarian carcinoma.

It is acknowledged that definitive genetic status is often not known or information about genetic status is not
provided to the pathologist at the time of biopsy/surgery. Moreover, this information is not essential for the
histological assessment and routine reporting of these tumours. Nevertheless, it is recommended that
available information on genetic status be recorded for the following reasons:
1. High grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) associated with BRCA mutations (germline or somatic) more
commonly show certain morphological features such as solid, pseudoendometrioid or transitional-like
(‘SET’) architectural patterns, very marked nuclear atypia, and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.5,7,8
Thus, pathologists may be able to correlate the histological findings with any genetic data provided,
better chemotherapy response, and consideration of specific therapeutic regimes such as those
including poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi).5,6,9 Patients with suspected germline BRCA
mutations and their relatives, may also be referred for genetic testing and counselling in regard to
appropriate screening for BRCA-related neoplasia, although in many places this is done for all HGSCs
irrespective of the tumour morphology.
2. Knowledge of proven or potential hereditary gynaecological cancer predisposition will affect
pathological sampling of macroscopically normal tissues. This is most evident in the setting of
prophylactic ‘risk reduction surgery’, especially in patients with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation,
where complete examination of tubal and ovarian tissues is essential.5 Small, macroscopically occult
tubal carcinomas, and their in situ precursor - serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) - is much
more likely to be identified in this setting.

Approximately 1-2% of all ovarian carcinomas are associated with LS due to a germline mutation in one of the
genes encoding the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins.10 In approximately 60% of women with LS, a
gynaecological tumour (endometrial or ovarian) will represent the sentinel cancer.11 Endometrioid and clear
cell and endometriosis-associated carcinomas occur more frequently in LS and, therefore,
immunohistochemical analysis of MMR proteins or molecular testing for microsatellite instability may be
considered in these tumour types, or if there is relevant personal or family history of additional LS-related
neoplasia.

Preoperative chemotherapy may significantly alter the gross and microscopic appearance of the tumour and
result in difficulties in tumour typing and tumour down-staging. If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is being
administered, a pretreatment tissue biopsy is recommended for tumour typing. If this is not possible then the
diagnosis of malignancy can be made on cytological examination of ascitic fluid, preferably with
immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on a cell block preparation; however, there are limitations to the
interpretation of immunohistochemical markers on cell blocks.12 Markers of value in tumour typing are
discussed in Note 18 ANCILLARY STUDIES.
       Back

Note 2 – Specimen(s) submitted (Core)

Providing information about the specimen type is regarded as an integral part of the reporting of primary
ovarian, tubal and peritoneal cancers. While the nature of the specimens submitted for pathological
assessment may be deduced from the surgical procedure, specifying the nature of the specimen received
provides complementary information and confirmation that entire organs have been resected and submitted.

Note 3 – Specimen integrity (Core)

Assessment of the integrity of the specimen (ovary or tube) is important, particularly for substaging of organ-
confined disease (Stage I). Core information should include whether the ovarian capsule or tubal serosa is
intact or ruptured, and also if there is tumour on the surface, or whether the tumour was received fragmented
or intact. In case of capsule rupture, it is recommended to try to ascertain if rupture occurred before or during
surgery (this is important in substaging International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IC
disease).13 Note that if the specimen ruptures within a bag during laparoscopic removal, or is cut into in the
operating room, after removal from the patient, such that the peritoneal cavity is not exposed to the contents
of the mass, it should be considered to be not ruptured i.e., ’intact’, for surgical pathology reporting purposes.

According to the 2014 FIGO Staging System for ovarian, tubal and primary peritoneal cancer,13 ovarian
capsular or tubal serosal rupture before surgery is considered Stage IC2 while intraoperative rupture is Stage
IC1. There is some controversy as to whether rupture during surgery worsens the prognosis in the absence of
surface excrescences, ascites or positive washings. Some studies showed a higher risk of recurrence in
association with intraoperative ovarian capsular rupture,14,15 while others did not.16-18

A 2014 meta-analysis assessed the impact of intraoperative rupture on prognosis, after analysing nine eligible
studies which included 2,382 patients.13 Patients with preoperative capsular rupture showed poorer
progression-free survival (PFS) than those with no rupture or intraoperative rupture. In sub-analyses,
preoperative rupture was associated with a worse prognosis, and intraoperative rupture had a poorer PFS
than no rupture. However, no difference in PFS was found between intraoperative rupture and no rupture in
patients who underwent a complete surgical staging operation, with or without adjuvant platinum-based
chemotherapy. In a recent large study, the risk associated with intra-operative rupture/Stage IC1 ovarian
carcinoma was histotype dependent and greatest for patients with clear cell carcinoma.19

There is some evidence to suggest that clear cell carcinomas exhibit a higher risk of rupture,20 probably related
to adhesions to the surrounding tissues, associated with tumour invasion or endometriosis.21 Capsular rupture
has also been associated with pregnancy.22
       Back

Note 4 – Tumour site/Histological sites of tumour involvement (Core)

Sites of tumour involvement should be recorded as this is necessary for tumour staging. Although site
assignment (tube versus ovary versus peritoneum) for clear cell, endometrioid, low grade serous and
mucinous carcinomas is generally not problematic since almost all arise in the ovary, except for occasional
cases arising in extraovarian endometriosis, the same is not true for HGSCs.

It was first recognised in 2001, that a high percentage of so-called ovarian HGSC in women with germline
BRCA1 mutations arise in the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube.23,24 This was initially reported in risk reducing
salpingo-oophorectomy specimens where early pre-invasive HGSCs were much more likely to be present in the
fallopian tube than ovary. These STICs harbour identical p53 mutations to the extratubal tumour, establishing
that they are clonal.25 Comparison of telomere length and centrosome amplification in matched STIC and
ovarian HGSC suggests that the STICs develop before the ovarian tumours and are in fact a precursor and not a
metastatic focus.26,27 Finally, although numbers are small, early, incidental non-BRCA1/2 associated (sporadic)
HGSCs are predominantly detected in the fallopian tube mucosa, especially the fimbria, rather than the
ovary.28 In summary, there is compelling evidence that the precursors of HGSC originate in the fallopian tube
in patients with germline BRCA1 mutations, and there is accumulating and convincing evidence that this is also
true for sporadic HGSC. Assignment of primary site should therefore reflect our current understanding of
where HGSCs originate, based on data from the study of early incidental or pre-invasive HGSC. However, some
cases of ovarian and primary peritoneal HGSCs do not show STIC lesions or tubal mucosal HGSC despite entire
submission of the grossly normal fallopian tubes for histological evaluation. In a consecutive series of non-

uterine HGSCs classified as ovarian or peritoneal based on pre-FIGO 2014 criteria in which the fallopian tubes
were examined in their entirety, STICs were identified in 59% of cases, and invasive HGSC of the mucosa of the
fallopian tube in an additional 15% of cases.13,29 In other cases, the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube was
obliterated by a tubo-ovarian mass.

According to the 2014 FIGO Staging System, the primary site of non-uterine HGSC is designated as ovarian,
tubal or primary peritoneal.13 In some cases it may not be possible to ascertain the primary site of origin, and
these should be categorised as ‘undesignated’ in the new staging system.13 The descriptor ‘tubo-ovarian HGSC’
can also be used in practice for those cases of advanced stage HGSC where there is uncertainty about primary
site, e.g., pre-treatment biopsy from the omentum. The problems in ascertaining the primary site and the
variation in practice amongst pathologists have significant implications for epidemiological studies,
determination of tumour incidence and mortality, data collection by cancer registries and entry into clinical
trials. Based on the 2020 WHO Classification,3 recommendations for assigning the site of origin of extra-uterine
HGSC are provided in the following section. Using these criteria, assignment of primary site is no longer based
on the site of greatest volume/size of tumour but the presence of STIC or tubal mucosa involvement by HGSC
indicates a fallopian tube origin, as does partial or total obliteration of one or both fallopian tubes by a tumour
mass. Application of these criteria will be important in ensuring consistency between different pathologists in
assigning the site of origin of HGSC with obvious important implications for cancer registration and other
parameters.30

Suggestions for assigning site of origin
The following suggestions are not intended to be an exhaustive list nor are they intended to be binding, and
assignment of origin in an individual case (Figure 1) is left to the discretion of the pathologist and the clinical
team, ideally in the setting of a multidisciplinary team meeting. Undoubtedly, there will be evolution over time
in our ability to accurately assign the primary tumour site, but the following are intended as practical
guidelines for handling cases at the present time:30
1. The fallopian tubes, or at least their fimbrial ends, should be well sampled – whenever possible - in all
cases of HGSC by a sectioning and extensively examining the fimbriated end (SEE-FIM)-like protocol25
to avoid missing this important site of disease, which probably represents the tumour origin in the
large majority of cases.
2. The presence of STIC, in the absence of invasive HGSC involving the fallopian tube, should be
considered as tubal primary for staging purposes, e.g., points 4 and 7.
3. The presence of STIC without invasion or extratubal spread should be staged as FIGO Stage IA tubal
carcinoma (although these have a favourable prognosis, based on limited experience to date31) but
with an annotation that there is no ‘invasive’ carcinoma.
4. Cases with only STIC in the fallopian tube, ovarian surface involvement or parenchymal involvement
not exceeding 5 millimetres (mm) and widespread peritoneal involvement, which would traditionally
be categorised as primary peritoneal carcinoma,32 should be classified as tubal primaries.
5. Cases with HGSC located within the mucosa of the fallopian tube, including its fimbrial end, with or
without STIC in any portion of the fallopian tube and with no, minimal or even substantial ovarian
involvement should be categorised as tubal primaries. Note that the distinction between STIC and
intramucosal HGSC of the fallopian tube is subjective, with the latter showing a greater degree of
stratification and architectural complexity.
6. Cases in which the fallopian tube is not identifiable, having presumably been overgrown by the
ipsilateral adnexal mass, or the distal end of the fallopian tube is incorporated into a large tubo-
ovarian mass should also, based on current understanding, be diagnosed as tubal primaries. It is
emphasised that a careful effort must be made to identify the tube in all cases.
7. Cases with a dominant ovarian mass(es) and identifiable fallopian tubes with STIC should be classified
as tubal primaries.
8. Cases with a dominant ovarian mass(es) and identifiable fallopian tubes without STIC or mucosal
involvement by HGSC, after SEE-FIM, should be classified as ovarian primaries.

9. Cases should be categorised as primary peritoneal carcinoma by the conventional criteria below3 and
only after complete histological examination of the fallopian tubes (including the non-fimbrial
portions) has excluded the presence of STIC or a small tubal HGSC or ovarian involvement by HGSC.
10. All cases classified as ‘undesignated’ for FIGO staging purposes should be further described as ‘tubo-
ovarian’ or ‘tubal/ovarian’ to distinguish them from serous carcinoma originating in the uterus. Using
the suggestions presented here, these should represent a small proportion of HGSC.
11. Cases with unilateral or bilateral HGSC in the ovary and/or STIC or HGSC in the tube but with an
endometrial serous intraepithelial or invasive carcinoma should be carefully evaluated for an
endometrial versus a tubo-ovarian primary (WT1 may be of value in such cases - see Note 18
ANCILLARY STUDIES, to distinguish between ovarian and uterine carcinoma). The majority of such
cases will represent adnexal metastases from an endometrial serous carcinoma.33

Note 5 – Tumour dimensions (Non-core)

There is little or no published evidence to suggest that size of the primary tumour is of prognostic significance,
and size is not important for staging or management. The principal reason for recording the tumour
dimensions, especially the maximum diameter, is to provide evidence that the tumour has been adequately
sampled for histology. There are no evidence-based guidelines as to the optimal sampling of solid or cystic
ovarian tumours. By convention, however, most pathologists sample one block per 10 mm of maximum
tumour diameter in solid tumours. These same recommendations appear in cancer datasets for tumours at a
range of other anatomical sites.

Adequate sampling of ovarian tumours is important for a number of reasons; for example, to identify foci of
microinvasion or invasion in borderline tumours, foci of sarcoma in an ovarian carcinoma (carcinosarcoma), or
foci of undifferentiated carcinoma in an endometrioid carcinoma (dedifferentiated carcinoma).

It is recognised that ovarian mucinous neoplasms may exhibit considerable intratumoural heterogeneity with
an admixture of benign, borderline and malignant areas. One study which assessed the ‘adequacy’ of sampling
in epithelial ovarian neoplasms,34 confirmed mucinous carcinomas to display more histological variation than
serous carcinomas. The authors concluded that more extensive sampling was required in borderline tumours
to exclude foci of invasion. According to the recommendations of the 2004 Bethesda Workshop for borderline
ovarian tumours,35 all borderline tumours should be well sampled – at least two sections per 10 mm (excluding
smooth-walled cystic foci) with the exception that borderline tumours of less than 100 mm should be sampled
with one block per 10 mm of maximum tumour diameter. The recommendation that there should be more
extensive sampling of larger tumours, especially those of mucinous type, reflects their greater likelihood of
harbouring foci of invasive carcinoma. Additional sampling of mucinous borderline tumours is also
recommended when histological features such as intraepithelial carcinoma or microinvasion are identified in
the original sections. Similarly, additional sampling in serous borderline tumours is recommended when
micropapillary areas or microinvasion are present in initial sections since such neoplasms are more likely to
harbour invasive foci.

In mucinous ovarian tumours, tumour size may be helpful in determining whether the ovarian neoplasm is
primary or metastatic. Unilateral mucinous carcinomas ≥100 mm in diameter are more likely to be primary
than metastatic.36,37

Note 6 – Macroscopic description of omentum (Core)

Three dimensions of the omentum should be provided in the pathology report to document the size of the
specimen received for pathological examination. This may be useful in certain scenarios to direct the need for
further surgery. For example, if initially only an omental biopsy was performed, further surgery may be
undertaken to remove the remainder of the omentum. The size of the specimen is also helpful to determine
the extent of sampling for histologic examination. No standardised guidelines have been developed for
sampling omental specimens in cases of ovarian carcinoma or borderline tumours. However, in the setting of a
grossly involved omentum, submitting one block for histologic examination is probably sufficient.38,39 In
patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, where histological assessment of tumour response to
therapy is recommended (see Note 15 RESPONSE TO NEOADJUVANT THERAPY), examination of 4-6 blocks of
omentum is suggested. For grossly negative omental specimens the sampling recommendations are variable –
sampling of 3-5 blocks is recommended in one study,39 other studies suggest at least one block for every 20
mm of maximum omental dimension.40 Taking this information into account, 4-6 blocks in cases where the
omentum is grossly negative in patients with an ovarian carcinoma or borderline tumour is recommended.

The size of the largest omental tumour deposit should be recorded in the pathology report. This is critical for
determining the pathological stage.3,13 Microscopic tumour which is not grossly evident, macroscopically
evident tumour ≤20 mm, and macroscopically evident tumour >20 mm, correspond to FIGO Stages IIIA2, IIIB,
and IIIC, respectively.13

Note 7 – Block identification key (Non-core)

The origin/designation of all tissue blocks should be recorded, and it is preferable to document this
information in the final pathology report. This is particularly important should the need for internal or external
review arise. The reviewer needs to be clear about the origin of each block in order to provide an informed
specialist opinion. If this information is not included in the final pathology report, it should be available on the
laboratory computer system and relayed to the reviewing pathologist. It may be useful to have a digital image
of the specimen and record of the origin of the tumour blocks in some cases.

Recording the origin/designation of tissue blocks also facilitates retrieval of blocks for further
immunohistochemical or molecular analysis, research studies or clinical trials.

Note 8 – Histological tumour type (Core)

All tubo-ovarian epithelial malignancies and borderline tumours should be typed according to the 2020 WHO
Classification of Tumours, Female Genital Tumours, 5th edition (Tables 1-3).3 There are five major histotypes of
primary ovarian carcinoma: low grade serous, high grade serous, clear cell, endometrioid and mucinous.41-44
There are also other uncommon minor types listed in the 2020 WHO Classification including malignant Brenner
tumour, mesonephric-like and undifferentiated carcinoma.3 As seromucinous carcinoma is considered a
morphologic variant of endometrioid carcinoma, it has thus been removed from the updated 2020 WHO
Classification.3 Carcinomas formerly diagnosed as seromucinous carcinoma are now included in the
endometrioid category. Carcinosarcoma is a mixed epithelial and mesenchymal malignancy but is included in
the category of epithelial malignancies in this dataset and in the 2020 WHO Classification since most are of
epithelial origin and histogenesis (epithelial mesenchymal transition).3,45

Although management of ovarian carcinoma is, at present, largely dependent on tumour stage and grade,
accurate typing will almost certainly become more important in the future with the introduction of targeted
therapies and specific treatments for different tumour types. This is in part because, although clinically often
considered as one disease, there is an increasing realisation that the different histotypes of ovarian carcinoma
have different origins, pathogenesis, are associated with distinct molecular alterations, and have a different
natural history, response to traditional chemotherapy, and prognosis.41-44 Tumour typing may also be
important in identifying or initiating testing for an underlying genetic predisposition. For example, HGSC may
be associated with underlying BRCA1/2 mutation while endometrioid carcinomas can occur in patients with
LS.46 The most common ovarian carcinoma is HGSC (approximately 70%) followed by clear cell and
endometrioid.47,48 Mucinous and low grade serous are less common. Approximately 90% of advanced stage
ovarian carcinomas (Stage III/IV) are high grade serous in type.47,48 Most primary tubal carcinomas are high
grade serous type.

Mixed ovarian carcinomas are now considered to be uncommon. It is recommended that all distinct
morphological types in an ovarian carcinoma are documented, even if they comprise less than 10% of the
neoplasm. As stated, mixed carcinomas in the ovary are uncommon, the most prevalent combination being
clear cell and endometrioid (both of these tumour types often arise in endometriosis). Most neoplasms which
were previously classified as mixed serous and endometrioid, and mixed serous and clear cell, represent
HGSCs with pseudoendometrioid areas and areas of cytoplasmic clearing respectively. In such cases,
immunohistochemical markers, especially WT1, may be useful (see Note 18 ANCILLARY STUDIES).

Borderline tumours should also be typed according to 2020 WHO Classification criteria.3 The most common
types are serous and mucinous. Seromucinous, endometrioid and Brenner types also occur. Clear cell
borderline tumour should only be diagnosed with the greatest caution, being certain to exclude carcinoma.

Note 9 – Pattern of invasion (Non-core)

It is controversial as to whether the pattern of invasion in Stage I mucinous ovarian carcinoma has prognostic
significance; therefore this is a non-core element.50-55 The expansile/confluent/non-destructive pattern of
invasion is characterised by architecturally complex glands, cysts or papillae lined by atypical epithelium with
minimal to no intervening stroma. The destructive/infiltrative pattern is characterised by haphazardly
arranged glands, tubules, nests and cords of malignant cells infiltrating stroma with an associated
oedematous, inflammatory or desmoplastic response. While several studies have shown the expansile pattern
heralds a better prognosis,50-52,54-57 a population-based registry study of mucinous ovarian carcinomas was not
able to prognosticate utilising the distinction between the two patterns of invasion.53 It is recommended that
the pattern of invasion in mucinous ovarian carcinomas be recorded. The focus of invasion should measure >5
mm in greatest linear extent; otherwise, this should be considered microinvasion or microinvasive carcinoma.

Note 10 – Carcinosarcoma components (Non-core)

There is little published evidence suggesting any prognostic significance of the different morphological
components within ovarian carcinosarcomas (although some prognostic evidence exists for uterine
carcinosarcomas).58-60 In view of the paucity of studies, the ICCR Ovary Carcinoma Dataset Authoring
Committee (DAC) recommends that it would be useful to record the percentage of the epithelial and
mesenchymal elements as well as the components of the epithelial and mesenchymal (homologous or
heterologous) elements. This is a recommendation rather than a requirement as collection of these data may
be informative for the future prognosis and management of these neoplasms.58-60

Note 11 – Histological tumour grade (Core and Non-core)

Histological grade is part of current European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)-European Society of
Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) management guidelines for endometrioid and mucinous carcinomas.61 Serous
carcinomas are now classified as low grade serous or high grade serous,3 and despite the names including the
term grade, these are two different histotypes rather than low grade and high grade variants of the same
tumour type. Hence, grading does not apply to serous carcinomas. Clear cell carcinomas, un-/dedifferentiated
carcinomas, anaplastic carcinomas, carcinosarcomas and mesonephric-like carcinomas are aggressive tumours
and grading does not apply. There is no grading system for malignant Brenner tumours. If chemotherapy has
been administered, tumour grading (and typing) may need to be based on the pre-chemotherapy biopsy.

The independent prognostic significance of grade for ovarian endometrioid carcinomas has only recently been
validated.62 The 1988 FIGO grading system is widely used for grading endometrioid carcinomas of ovarian and
endometrial origin.13 The FIGO grading system is based on architecture; tumours with <5% non-squamous solid
component are grade 1, those with 5-50% solid areas are grade 2, and tumours with >50% of solid architecture
are classified as grade 3.13 When grade 1 and 2 tumours show severe nuclear atypia in the majority of the
tumour cells (grade 3 nuclei), the histological grade is increased by one.13,63

Dedifferentiation in endometrioid carcinoma, sometimes with Switch/Sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF)
alterations, results in highly aggressive behaviour and such tumours are high grade by definition.64 A significant
majority of ovarian endometrioid carcinomas are grade 1 and 2. However, there is a subset of grade 3
endometrioid carcinomas which should be diagnosed with caution, since a significant proportion of such
tumours are in fact HGSC with so called SET features (solid, pseudoendometrioid, transitional cell). IHC is
useful in this regard (see Note 18 ANCILLARY STUDIES). The interobserver reproducibility of grading is limited
and several studies have attempted to improve on it.65-70 There are shortcomings of a primarily architecturally
based grading system. Certain growth patterns of endometrioid carcinoma such as spindled with bland nuclear
features may be over-graded. On the contrary, tumours with non-solid architecture but high grade nuclear
atypia may be under-graded. For example, in a recent study a number of p53 abnormal (p53abn) ovarian
endometrioid carcinomas with aggressive course were graded as 1.62

As compared to the FIGO grading system,13 the Silverberg grading system71 was found to correlate better with
survival in a multivariate analysis, although outcome in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma is mostly dictated by
stage.63 The Silverberg system (Table 4) takes into account nuclear atypia and mitotic activity in addition to
architecture. Thus, the scores for architecture (majority glandular=1, papillary=2, solid=3), nuclear atypia
(mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3), mitotic activity per mm2 of tumour area or in 10 high power fields (HPF)
(based on each HPF being 0.345 mm2 in area, as per the original study;71 0-3 mitotic figures/mm2 (or 0 to 9
mitotic figures per 10 HPF) =1, 3-7 mitotic figures/mm2 (or 10 to 24 mitotic figures per 10 HPF) =2, and >7
mitotic figures/mm2 (or ≥25 mitotic figures per 10 HPF) =3) are added to obtain a score for determining the
final grade (G1: 3 to 5, G2: 6 to 7, G3: 8 to 9). The better performance of the Silverberg system was attributed
to the better separation of grade 2 from the grade 3 tumours, which had a poor outcome.63

The DAC panel agrees that there is insufficient evidence for a change in the grading system of endometrioid
carcinomas and continues to recommend the FIGO grading system.13

In addition to grading, molecular subtype assignment may further improve outcome prediction in the same
way as for endometrioid carcinoma of the uterus; this is done with IHC for MMR proteins and p53 and by
sequencing for exonuclease domain mutations (EDM) of Polymerase epsilon (POLE).62,72

Some management guidelines for mucinous carcinomas require grading.61 The DAC previously suggest that if
grading of mucinous carcinomas is undertaken (a non-core element rather than a core element), the same
grading system for endometrioid carcinomas should be used. However, a recent study showed no prognostic
significance of the FIGO grading system and reemphasised that mucinous carcinomas only rarely show a solid
growth pattern.73 In this study, the Silverberg grade was significantly associated with survival, although all
mucinous carcinomas were graded as grade 1 or 2 by the Silverberg system, and none as grade 3.73 The DAC
now recommends the Silverberg grading system71 for mucinous carcinomas as a non-core reporting element.

The same study also proposed a growth-based grading system based on the pattern of invasion.73
Expansile/confluent invasion or infiltrative invasion ≤10% of the tumour is graded as 1 while infiltrative
invasion >10% is graded as 2.73 This was significantly associated with survival in univariable analysis in this
relatively small study of 46 cases.74 This corroborates earlier studies showing that while infiltrative invasion is
associated with higher stage, it also predicts higher risk of recurrence at Stage I.53,57,74,75 It is important to note,
however, that an infiltrative pattern of invasion is a characteristic feature of metastatic mucinous carcinoma.
In one study, the infiltrative pattern of invasion lost its significant association with survival after metastatic
carcinomas to the ovary were excluded.76 If an infiltrative/destructive pattern is present, metastatic carcinoma
should carefully be ruled out. The quantification of the infiltrative component as focal (≤10%) or diffuse (>10%)
may be recorded to allow more data to be gathered for future studies.

Note 12 – Borderline tumour - special features (Core and Non-core)

Terminology for ovarian borderline tumours has evolved over several years.40,77 The preferred terminology is
borderline tumour, for example serous or mucinous borderline tumour, and this has been endorsed in the
2020 WHO Classification.3 Serous borderline tumours can be of typical or micropapillary subtypes, as per the
latest WHO Classification.3 For mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, Brenner, and seromucinous tumours, the
designation ‘borderline tumour’ is also used in the 2020 WHO Classification.3 The terms ‘low malignant
potential’ or ‘atypical proliferative’ are not recommended.3 Synonyms formerly used for seromucinous
borderline tumours include endocervical-type mucinous borderline tumour, Müllerian mucinous borderline
tumour, and atypical proliferative (borderline) Müllerian tumour.78

Determining the lowest threshold for the diagnosis of a borderline tumour in the setting of a
cystadenoma/cystadenofibroma with minimal epithelial proliferation can be subjective and quantitative
criteria have been suggested: cystadenomas/cystadenofibromas with qualitatively sufficient epithelial
stratification/complexity involving ≥10% of the epithelial volume are designated as borderline tumours arising
within a cystadenoma/cystadenofibroma.40 A borderline tumour in which the epithelial
stratification/complexity involves <10% of the epithelial volume should be diagnosed as cystadenoma/
cystadenofibroma with focal epithelial proliferation.

As serous borderline tumour can exhibit variable degrees of micropapillary or cribriform architecture, a
diagnosis of micropapillary subtype of serous borderline tumour is based on the presence of ≥5 mm of
confluent micropapillary (defined as micropapillae five times as long as they are wide) or cribriform growth.3

A standardised quantitative criterion for distinguishing microinvasion from frankly invasive carcinoma within a
borderline tumour has not been established, with varying definitions used in different studies, including 1, 2, 3,
5 and 10 mm2 as the upper limits of microinvasion.40,77,79 The 2020 WHO Classification uses 5 mm2 as a cut-off.3
Some groups distinguish two patterns of stromal invasion in serous tumours which quantitatively falls short of
frankly invasive carcinoma (<5 mm) - conventional ‘microinvasion’ (isolated and/or small clusters of
eosinophilic cells and/ or small papillae cytologically similar to the non-invasive component within clear
lacunar spaces) and ‘microinvasive carcinoma’ (glandular or micropapillary patterns qualitatively analogous to
low grade serous carcinoma (LGSC)).40,77 However, other investigators do not advocate this distinction. Due to
insufficient numbers of cases in the literature, definitive conclusions regarding the clinical significance of this
distinction cannot be drawn.77,80 Analogous to the situation for serous tumours, some investigators advocate
the separation of ‘microinvasion’ from ‘microinvasive carcinoma’ in mucinous borderline tumours while others
use these two terms interchangeably.79

In mucinous borderline tumours, intraepithelial carcinoma is diagnosed in non-invasive foci with marked
nuclear atypia, and is often associated with mitotic activity.40,79 However, the reproducibility of this diagnosis
has not been formally analysed. It has recently been suggested that p53 IHC could be used instead or in
support of a diagnosis of intraepithelial carcinoma but this remains to be proven.81 Intraepithelial carcinoma
for mucinous borderline tumours is a non-core item for reporting and the term intraepithelial carcinoma is not
applied to other types of borderline tumour. Mucinous borderline tumours can be associated with mural
nodules, which are classified as reactive sarcoma-like, anaplastic carcinoma, or sarcoma.

Sarcoma-like nodules are composed of a variable mixture of spindled/round mononucleated cells, often
associated with marked inflammation.

Extra-ovarian implants occur in approximately 20% of serous borderline tumours and are more common with
exophytic neoplasms. The most important adverse prognostic factor for ovarian serous borderline tumours in
which there is extra-ovarian disease, is the presence of invasive implants, i.e., LGSC, in extra-ovarian tissues as
this portends an adverse prognosis, with non-invasive implants having a favourable prognosis. Specifying the
location and size of implants is important for determining the FIGO stage.13 Non-invasive and invasive
implants/LGSC may co-exist in the same specimen. Non-invasive implants are subclassified as epithelial or
desmoplastic types.40 Epithelial-type non-invasive implants resemble detached fragments of a serous

borderline tumour involving extra-ovarian tissues. They do not exhibit infiltration of underlying tissue, and
they are often present within mesothelial or epithelial-lined spaces although they may be adherent to the
serosal surface. Desmoplastic non-invasive implants are composed of glands or papillary clusters within
fibroblastic or granulation tissue-like stroma, but they do not exhibit infiltration of adjacent tissue. Often these
are located on serosal surfaces or within septa in the omentum. Note that the presence of isolated individual
or small clusters of eosinophilic epithelial cells within the stroma is generally considered to be within the
spectrum of desmoplastic non-invasive implants rather than representing an invasive implant/LGSC.77

The most widely used criterion for diagnosing extra-ovarian LGSC/invasive implants in a patient with an
ovarian serous borderline tumour is destructive invasion of underlying tissue.82 Invasive implants often feature
markedly crowded epithelial nests, glands or micropapillary clusters with a haphazard arrangement. The nests,
glands and papillae are sometimes surrounded by clefts.40,77

In occasional cases, it may not be possible to definitively distinguish non-invasive from invasive implants/LGSC
and the recommendation is to designate such implants as being of indeterminate type.83 This terminology
should only be used sparingly, and obtaining a specialist gynaecological pathology opinion and submitting
additional sections for histological examination (if an omentectomy specimen), may be useful.

When invasive implants are present this should be diagnosed in the final pathology report as extra-ovarian
LGSC;40,77,84 this has been endorsed in the 2020 WHO Classification.3 It is unclear whether invasive implants
involving extra-ovarian sites in association with an ovarian serous borderline tumour represent metastases
from the serous borderline tumour or an independent primary peritoneal tumour. A number of molecular
studies analysing primary ovarian tumours with their associated implants have yielded varying results.77
However, Ardighieri et al (2014) showed in a large population-based cohort has shown that the vast majority
of implants are clonally related to the primary ovarian tumour.85 Most of the cases from this study were non-
invasive implants; however, all 10 invasive implants had the same mutational status (KRAS mutation, BRAF
mutation, or wild-type KRAS/BRAF) as the corresponding serous borderline tumour, suggesting that invasive
implants are clonally related to the primary ovarian tumour as opposed to representing independent primary
peritoneal lesions.85 Nevertheless, the number of invasive implants evaluated by molecular methods in the
entire literature is limited. Carcinoma developing in patients with a previous diagnosis of serous borderline
tumour are mostly LGSCs and most are clonally related to the serous borderline tumour i.e., represent tumour
progression.86 From a practical point of view, for cases of invasive implants in association with an ovarian
tumour diagnosed as serous borderline tumour, it is recommended to consider additional sampling of ovarian
tissue to demonstrate LGSC or micropapillary serous borderline tumour.87

Implants may also be encountered in the setting of seromucinous borderline tumours, and the same issues for
serous tumours pertain. In general implants do not occur in the setting of mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell
or Brenner borderline tumours.

Note 13 – Serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) (Core)

Recently, STIC has been implicated in the pathogenesis of extra-uterine HGSC. The evidence indicating that
STIC is a precursor of most HGSCs that were formerly considered to be of tubal, ovarian or primary peritoneal
origin, as well as guidelines for assigning primary site in cases of advanced stage non-uterine, HGSC, have
already been provided (see Note 4 HISTOLOGICAL SITES OF TUMOUR INVOLVEMENT). STIC comprises a
population of cytologically malignant epithelial cells replacing the normal tubal mucosa, most commonly
involving the fimbria, and characterised by increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with rounded nuclei, loss of
cell polarity, coarsely clumped chromatin, prominent nucleoli and absence of ciliated cells. Additional features
that may be present include epithelial stratification, small fracture lines in the epithelium and tufting and
exfoliation from the tubal surface of small epithelial cell clusters.

The diagnostic criteria for STIC have evolved and guidelines for diagnosis, which include the use of p53 and Ki-
67 (MIB1) immunostaining, have been published.88-90 Use of these criteria results in a high degree of inter-
observer diagnostic agreement. In discrete fallopian tube mucosal lesions (usually, but not always, located in
the fimbria) with high grade atypia in non-ciliated epithelium, the presence of abnormal p53 immunostaining
(three mutation-type patterns: overexpression, complete absence and cytoplasmic) and high Ki-67
proliferation index (≥10%) support a diagnosis of STIC. Although immunostains are a valuable adjunct in the
diagnosis of isolated lesions of the fallopian tube, they are usually not needed to diagnosis STIC in the context
of advanced stage HGSC, where comparison between the tubal mucosal lesion and HGSC elsewhere reveals
identical cytological features, with high grade atypia and numerous mitotic figures. Fallopian tube epithelial
lesions with atypia that do not meet all the criteria for STIC (e.g., tubal intraepithelial lesion in
transition/serous tubal intraepithelial lesion, synonymous terms for lesions that have some but not all features
of STIC) are of uncertain significance at present with poor reproducibility and these are not reportable
diagnoses and should generally not be used in routine practice; additional research is required to determine
the clinical significance, if any, of such lesions. Similarly, p53 signatures should not be reported as a diagnosis.

Fallopian tube mucosal involvement by uterine or non-gynaecological primary tumours can occur and mimic
STIC.91-93 Most cases with unilateral or bilateral HGSC in the ovary and/or STIC or HGSC in the tube but with an
endometrial serous intraepithelial or invasive carcinoma will represent adnexal metastases from an
endometrial serous carcinoma (see Note 18 ANCILLARY STUDIES).94 A diagnosis of STIC always requires
consideration of clinical and pathological findings and the exclusion of secondary involvement of the fallopian
tube.

Note 14 – Peritoneal cytology (Core)

The results of peritoneal cytology (peritoneal washings or peritoneal fluid) are important for the substaging of
Stage I ovarian tumours (borderline and malignant). Positive peritoneal washings in a Stage I tumour signify
Stage IC3 in the 2014 FIGO Staging System.13 In the previous 2006 FIGO Staging System,95 the results of
peritoneal cytology were used for the substaging of Stage II neoplasms, but this is no longer the case. Positive
peritoneal cytology in a Stage I carcinoma may indicate the need for adjuvant therapy in certain cases. Cells of
LGSC and serous borderline tumour cannot be reliably distinguished in a cytology specimen; in such cases, the
cytology findings should be correlated with the histopathological findings.

Note 15 – Response to neoadjuvant therapy (Non-core)

Histological assessment of chemotherapy response is only applicable to HGSC at this time. An initial study has
tested and validated the prognostic significance of chemotherapy response criteria, and assessed
reproducibility in two independent series of tubo-ovarian HGSC.96,97 This three-tier scoring system (the
Chemotherapy Response Score (CRS)) is reproducible, simple to apply in practice, and has been validated in an
international multicentre study.98 This is the grading system currently recommended by the DAC. The method
is as follows:
1. Scoring should be carried out on a single haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained section (refer to
discussion of omental sampling in Note 6 Macroscopic description of omentum).
2. A single block of involved omental tissue that shows the least response to chemotherapy should be
selected (if there is no residual omental tumour a CRS score of 3 is given - see Table 5).
3. The amount of viable tumour should be assessed; this may or may not show degenerative changes in
the form of nuclear atypia, smudging of the nuclear chromatin and cytoplasmic clearing.

4. The presence of fibrosis may be helpful in marking the site of previous tumour infiltration:
a.
When found in the absence of tumour, fibrosis is likely to indicate regression.
b.
If fibrosis occurs in association with tumour, this may simply reflect tumour-associated
desmoplasia rather than regression.
c.
However, when fibrosis in association with tumour is accompanied by an inflammatory response
(so-called ‘fibro-inflammatory’ response – fibrosis with associated macrophages and a mixed
population of inflammatory cells), this indicates regression.
d.
Psammoma bodies may mark the site of previous tumour and can sometimes appear more
numerous because their density increases in areas where tumour has disappeared.
5. As a guide, >95% of tumour should be viable for a score of 1, and <5% for a score of 3.
6. In studies to date using this system or a closely related system, a difference in prognosis was shown
only when tumours with a CRS score of 1 or 2 were compared with those having a CRS score of 3.96,97
However, the DAC recommends use of the three-tier system to gather more data for future studies.
7. Note that this system has only been applied to HGSCs to date.
8. If the omental tissue appears normal, with neither tumour cells nor fibrosis, it is important to
ascertain that there was omental involvement prior to the start of chemotherapy, that has completely
regressed, by review of the clinical and radiological findings, before assigning a CRS score of 3. If there
was no omental involvement prior to starting chemotherapy, then a CRS score cannot be applied.

Note 16 – Lymph node status (Core)

In the revised 2014 FIGO Staging System, metastases involving retroperitoneal lymph nodes, in the absence of
peritoneal spread above the pelvic brim or distant metastases, represent Stage IIIA1 disease.13 This stage is
further subdivided into Stages IIIA1(i) and IIIA1(ii) for nodal metastases ≤10 mm and >10 mm, respectively.
Formerly, regional node metastases were a criterion for Stage IIIC disease and this amendment is based upon
evidence that patients with only nodal metastases (in the absence of peritoneal disease) have a relatively
favourable outcome - although it should be noted that the data are based mainly on cases of HGSC.99,100
Positive extra-abdominal lymph nodes including inguinal metastases represent Stage IVB disease.

International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) specifically restricts the definition of Stage IIIA1
disease to retroperitoneal lymph nodes (pelvic and para-aortic) but does not indicate how tumour spread to
intraperitoneal nodes (such as those in the mesentery or omentum) should be interpreted, although it would
be very unusual to have isolated nodal metastases at these sites.13 According to FIGO (personal
communication), this should be regarded as intra-abdominal disease, i.e., Stage IIIC.101,102 At present there are
also limited data to justify the subdivision of Stage IIIA1 according to the size of the nodal metastases.13 It is
also not clear how the extent of nodal involvement (≤10 mm or >10 mm) should be measured if the diagnosis
is based only upon cytological sampling. According to FIGO (personal communication), this should be regarded
as Stage IIIA(i) disease.

Data on lymph node involvement in borderline ovarian tumours is largely restricted to tumours of serous
subtype where approximately 25% of fully staged cases will show positive nodes.103,104 While this finding does
not appear to influence overall survival, cases with nodular epithelial tumour aggregates >1 mm in extent may
show decreased disease-free survival.105 Rarely, LGSC appears to develop within the lymph nodes of patients
with ovarian serous borderline tumours.106

According to TNM8,107 nodal involvement should be recorded as the presence of isolated tumour cells (ITC,
<0.2 mm), micrometastases (MIC, 0.2-2 mm) or macrometastases (MAC, >2 mm).

Note 17 – Coexistent pathology/Precursor lesions (Non-core)

Borderline and malignant endometrioid, clear cell and seromucinous ovarian tumours may arise from
endometriosis. Thus, the presence of endometriosis, although not of prognostic or therapeutic significance,
particularly if contiguous with the tumour, may assist in determining the histotype in problematic cases.108,109
       Back

Note 18 – Ancillary studies (Non-core)

Morphology remains the mainstay in ovarian carcinoma diagnosis. Diagnostic ancillary testing is currently
based primarily on IHC. Diagnostic immunohistochemical markers may assist in establishing a diagnosis of a
primary ovarian carcinoma or aid in histotyping. It is beyond the scope of this dataset to present a detailed
analysis (sensitivity, specificity, cut-off interpretation) but the most commonly used first-line
immunohistochemical panels are discussed. In general, panels of markers are better than reliance on
individual markers and it should be remembered that no marker is totally specific or sensitive for any tumour
type. Unexpected positive and negative staining reactions may occur. Therefore, the results of
immunohistochemical studies should always be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical, gross and
microscopic features.109,110

The choice of ancillary tests for the distinction of a primary ovarian carcinoma from a metastatic malignancy
(Table 6) depends on its morphological context and can be problematic particularly on small or cytological
specimens.
