    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a special pathological type of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and has a high prevalence in Asia without specific molecular subtype classification. Endometriosis is a recognized precancerous lesion that carries 3-fold increased risk of OCCC. Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, which also originates from endometriosis, shares several features with OCCC, including platinum resistance and younger age at diagnosis. Patients with OCCC have about a 2.5 to 4 times greater risk of having a venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with other EOC, and OCCC tends to metastasize through lymphatic vesicular and peritoneal spread as opposed to hematogenous metastasis. There is only mild elevation of the conventional biomarker CA125. Staging surgery or optimal cytoreduction combined with chemotherapy is a common therapeutic strategy for OCCC. However, platinum resistance commonly portends a poor prognosis, so novel treatments are urgently needed. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are currently being studied, including PARP, EZH2, and ATR inhibitors combined with the synthetic lethality of ARID1A-dificiency, and MAPK/PI3K/HER2, VEGF/bFGF/PDGF, HNF1β, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Advanced stage, suboptimal cytoreduction, platinum resistance, lymph node metastasis, and VTE are major prognostic predictors for OCCC. We focus on update pathogenesis, diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches to provide future directions for clinical diagnosis and treatment of OCCC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, and most patients experience recurrence after primary treatment. Currently, there is no standard treatment option for recurrent OCCC. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old female patient with OCCC. The patient received primary cytoreductive surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and remained disease-free for four months. She then experienced retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence and was treated with liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy followed by secondary debulking surgery. The patient experienced a second relapse in the lower left lung 11 months later. Genomic profiling of tumor samples revealed a deleterious AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) mutation and homologous recombination deficiency. Thus, the triplet combination of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib; the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab; and the antiangiogenic agent, bevacizumab was administered. The patient achieved partial response, which was sustained for 12 months. Our study provides the first clinical evidence that the combination of olaparib with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab could be an effective treatment for patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent OCCC.",

    "abstract": "NUCOLL43 is a novel ovarian clear cell carcinoma (O-CCC) cell line that arose from a primary culture of a patient's malignant ascites. The cells grow reliably in cell culture with a doubling time of approx. 45 hours and form colonies at high efficiency. They have a very high degree of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting approximately 85% of the genome, mostly copy neutral and almost identical to the original tumor. The cells express epithelial (pan-cytokeratin) and mesenchymal (vimentin) characteristics, CA125 and p16, like the original tumor. They also express ARID1A but not HNF-1β and, like the original tumor, and are negative for p53 expression, with no evidence of p53 function. NUCOLL43 cells express all other DNA damage response proteins investigated and have functional homologous recombination DNA repair. They are insensitive to cisplatin, the PARP inhibitor rucaparib, and MDM2 inhibitors but are sensitive to camptothecin, paclitaxel, and NVP-BEZ235. The NUCOLL43 cell line represents a distinct subtype of O-CCC that is p53 and HNF-1β null but expresses ARID1A. Its high degree of similarity with the original tumor genomically and proteomically, as well as the high level of LOH, make this an interesting cell line for O-CCC research.

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a rare type of epithelial ovarian cancer characterized by a chemoresistant phenotype and high-grade tumor. Conventional therapies for OCCC include surgery and chemotherapy. However, these OCCC treatment approaches are characterized by a high risk of relapse and drug resistance resulting in poor prognosis. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches are required to achieve better outcomes. In this study, a PIK3CA p.R88Q mutation and PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score of 10% was explored in a patient who presented with rapid recurrence after surgery and unsuccessful postoperative chemotherapy. Based on the clinical condition and the patient preference, she was administered a novel combinatorial therapy comprising mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which is a well-known and potent inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and the anti-PD-1 antibody toripalimab. Treatment with this combinatorial therapy showed good prognosis, with more than eight months of disease control, and no severe adverse events were observed. The findings of this study provide a novel and effective strategy for OCCC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a new combination regimen of immunotherapy (everolimus plus toripalimab) for solid tumors. Everolimus is not only an antitumor targeted drug but also an immunosuppressant; it's combination with immunotherapy is controversial. This is the first report to demonstrate that it has a synergistic effect.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) is rare, occurring approximately in 1% of women with ovarian endometriosis. The main histological types are endometrioid adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), with the latter being the least common.\n          \nIn our hospital, we recently summarized two patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma with similar characteristics. They all had endometriosis for a long time and had undergone ovarian cyst removal due to a chocolate cyst. Unfortunately, the cyst recurred after surgery, and the histological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. In case 1, the expression of P53 was found in the tumor by regular examination, and the stage was IIB. In Case 2, we found it in intraoperative freezing; the stage was IA. Case 1 has been treated with the TP regimen six times, and the survival period has reached one year. Case 2 had a survival period of 6 years after completing six TP regimen treatments. Clinicians should pay attention to patients with a long history of endometriosis and postoperative recurrence of ovarian cysts accompanied by serum CA-125 of more than 200U/mL. Imaging examination has a good prospect in diagnosing malignant transformation of endometriosis, especially PET-CT.\n          \nThis case report highlights the risk factors related to the formation of ovarian clear cell carcinoma and suggests that the follow-up of patients with ovarian endometriosis is essential because of its recurrence characteristics.

Here, we present the case of a patient with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) who failed to respond to multiline chemotherapy and target therapy but achieved an immune complete response (iCR) with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor treatment. The overall survival (OS) was 59 months, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 34 months after immunotherapy, which was counting. Meantime, molecular testing results revealed that traditional biomarkers for immunotherapy, including PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB), were negative. HLA-B44 (B*18:01) supertype was confirmed by sequence-based HLA typing.

    "abstract": "This retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nedaplatin plus paclitaxel (NP) compared with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (CP) in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients with histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer with recurrent interval ≥6 months after finishing platinum-based therapies between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014 were investigated. Patients received an intravenous infusion of NP (nedaplatin 80 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) or CP (carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) protocols every 3 weeks for at least 6-8 cycles or until disease progression. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were toxicity and overall survival (OS). 436 patients were included in the study, containing 241 cases receiving CP regimen and 195 cases receiving NP regimen, who were all contained in safety analysis. Because of 61 patients with unbearable toxicity and poor compliance, 375 patients were finally included in the efficacy analysis. With median follow-up of 63.5 months, PFS was 11.0 months with NP regimen versus 9.5 months with CP regimen (P=0.109). Subgroup analysis indicated that PFS of the NP arm was statistically superior to the CP arm when recurrent interval was 6-12 months (P=0.048); median PFS was 10.0 versus 8.0 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall survival between two groups. More frequent grade 3-4 neutropenia (13.3% vs 33.6%), thrombocytopenia (5.6% vs 14.5%) and hypersensitivity reactions (5.6% vs 21.9% ) were observed in CP arm (P<0.01). Compared to the CP, NP regimen did not improve 5-year overall survival in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, but it had better tolerance. NP obtained significant benefit in progression-free survival when the recurrent interval was between 6 and 12 months, although the efficacy of two regimens were similar when the recurrent interval ≥12 months.",

While treatment with carboplatin enriches for CA125-negative cells, co-treatment with carboplatin and birinapant eliminates these cells in HGSCs expressing high levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein cIAP in the CA125-negative population. Birinapant sensitizes CA125-negative cells to carboplatin by mediating degradation of cIAP causing cleavage of caspase 8 and restoration of apoptosis. This co-therapy significantly improves disease-free survival in vivo compared with either therapy alone in tumour-bearing mice. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies that target CA125-negative cells may be useful in the treatment of HGSC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma has a high recurrence rate with poor prognosis and is generally not sensitive to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. Its less frequent occurrence of mutations such as BRCA limited the targeted therapies. Immunotherapy is not currently recommended as a first-line agent for ovarian cancer, and most patients are not yet able to benefit from it. Cryoablation can be used to treat solid systemic tumors, including ovarian cancer metastases, and can produce a limited anti-tumor immune response. The anti-tumor effects of cryoablation combined with immunotherapy have not been adequately confirmed. This study reports a case of a patient with ovarian clear cell carcinoma who underwent conventional adjuvant chemotherapy after initially surgical resection of the tumor. Unfortunately, cancer recurred and metastasized to the abdominal wall. After a series of painful chemotherapy and a second surgery, the cancer was still not effectively controlled, and the patient developed extensive metastases in the lung. The patient's PD-L1 expression level also did not support solo immunotherapy. We pioneered the use of cryoablation to first eradicate the most significant lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung and then combined it with the PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab to treat the patient with immunotherapy, which resulted in the complete eradication of the other multiple metastases in the lung and saved the patient's life. Although the precise mechanism of action has not yet been explored, we have reason to believe that the combination of cryoablation and immune checkpoint inhibitor has a powerful synergistic anti-tumor effect, which is yet to be confirmed by more basic research and clinical applications in the next step.",

In this study, surgically resected samples were collected from 44 patients with OCCC. Genomic alterations were determined using next-generation sequencing. HRD was estimated by genomic instability. Of 44 patients with OCCC, two (4.5%) harbored likely pathogenic mutations in HRR genes. Notably, no pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were found in BRCA1/2. A total of 24 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in HRR-related genes occurred in 18 (40.9%) patients. HRD was observed in only one case (2.3%). In addition, TP53 mutation and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) were identified in three patients (6.8%) and in one patient (2.3%), respectively. TP53 mutation was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival. No POLE mutations were found. In conclusion, our results revealed a very low prevalence of HRR gene mutations and HRD in OCCC. Moreover, TP53 mutations and MSI-H are uncommon, while POLE mutations are extremely rare in OCCC. Our findings indicate that the evaluation of HRR gene mutations, HRD status, POLE mutations, and MSI-H may have limited clinical significance for OCCC treatment and prognostic stratification.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway deficiency (HRD) is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) as well as in the sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy drugs. In this study, we obtained data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on HGSOC and identified scores for the loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions, and calculated the HRD score. We then investigated the relationships among the score, genetic/epigenetic alterations in HRR-related genes, and the clinical data. We found that BRCA1/2 mutations were enriched in the group with HRD scores ≥63. Compared with the groups with scores ≤62, this group had a good prognosis; we thus considered HRD scores ≥63 to be the best cutoff point for identifying HRD cases in HGSOC. Classification of HGSOC cases by the HRD status revealed a better prognosis for HRD cases caused by genetic alterations (genetic HRD) than those caused by epigenetic changes and those caused by undetermined reasons (p = 0.0002). Among cases without macroscopic residual tumors after primary debulking surgery, 11 of 12 genetic HRD cases survived after the median observation period of 6.6 years, showing remarkably high survival rates (p = 0.0059). In conclusion, HGSOC can be classified into subtypes with different prognoses according to HRD status. This classification could be useful for personalized HGSOC treatment.",

Prognosis is generally poor, and no treatment guidelines are offered. Here, we report a case of OSCCHT successfully treated by complete excision and a postoperative chemotherapy scheme of carboplatin and paclitaxel. A 29-year-old female with with pelvic mass and significantly increased serum calcium (4.90 mmol/L) was referred to our hospital on August 22, 2013. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a pelvic nonhomogeneous echo of a 113×102 mm mass, possibly coming from the adnexa of the uterus. Preoperative examinations indicated high levels of serum calcium and relevant acute renal dysfunction; hence, continuous renal replacement therapy was performed until all tests reached minimum operation requirements. Interestingly, after excision, serum calcium levels decreased rapidly and therefore, extra calcium had to be taken in order to take the level back up to normal. The patient was diagnosed with OSCCHT based on the clinical data and pathological examinations. After six cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was in a good condition and on follow-up there were no signs of recurrence.",

    "title": "Novel biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of ovarian clear cell carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma can arise from endometriosis; however, it is distinct from other types of epithelial ovarian carcinoma in terms of its clinicopathological and molecular features. Cancer antigen 125 lacks the sensitivity and specificity required for accurate clinical diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Therefore, the aim of the current review was to identify novel biomarker candidates for the immunohistochemical and serological diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. A search of the relevant English language literature published between 1966 and 2014 was conducted using the PubMed MEDLINE online database. High-throughput tissue microarray technology and proteomic screening combined with mass spectrometry may provide additional information regarding diagnostic biomarker candidates for ovarian clear cell carcinoma. The present review summarizes the characteristics of potential genomic alterations that activate cancer signaling pathways and, thus, contribute to carcinogenesis. The major signaling pathways activated in clear cell carcinoma are associated with cell cycle regulation (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 and tumor protein D52), growth factor signaling (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1; KiSS-1 metastasis-suppressor; erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2), anti-apoptosis and survival pathways [sialidase 3 (membrane sialidase)], metabolism (γ-glutamyltransferase 1), chemoresistance (napsin A aspartic peptidase, glutathione peroxidase 3; and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1), coagulation [coagulation factor III (thromboplastin, tissue factor); and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2], signaling (lectin, galactoside-binding and soluble, 3), and adhesion and the extracellular matrix [cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (epithelial); versican; and laminin, α 5]. The present review of the relevant literature may provide a basis for additional clinical investigation of the ovarian clear cell carcinoma serum biomarker candidate proteins identified herein.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer with distinct pathological features, molecular profiles, and biological functions. OCCC has high incidence rates in East Asia compared to the Western hemisphere and Europe and is associated with endometriosis. With its relative resistance to conventional treatment regimens and the worst stage-adjusted prognosis among ovarian cancer subtypes, there is an urgent need to optimize therapeutic options and to improve patient outcomes. To achieve this goal, better patient stratification strategies are required. These strategies could derive from comprehensive and in-depth multidimensional analysis of tumor heterogeneity. Understanding intertumor heterogeneity could assist us in stratifying OCCC patients based on features that are prognostic or predictive. Recent genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling analyses allow us to provide an integrative perspective on the diverse heterogeneity in OCCC that could pave the way for novel translational research and clinical development in the future.",

Multiple metastases of SNEC are even more rare, and patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease generally face a poor outcome. To date, only a few cases of SNEC have been reported. Here, we describe a rare case of a 70-year-old female patient with SNEC of the tonsil who presented with multiple metastases and had achieved a complete response (CR) of the primary lesion and cervical lymph nodes for more than 1 year after receiving palliative chemotherapy. Initially, the patient presented with a 2-month history of throat pain. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed a soft mass with moderate enhancement on the left tonsil, which was confirmed by incisional aspiration biopsy. She was additionally sent for a positron emission tomography scan to evaluate small metastases in the left cervical lymph node, right lung, multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, and the fourth lumbar (L4) vertebra body metastases. Histopathological examination of the SNEC confirmed a nested, typical endocrine appearance with small round cells containing ovoid-shaped nuclei and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 8/18+, synaptophysin+, CD56+, and Ki-67 (<50%). The patient received 6 cycles of cisplatin combined with etoposide and was subsequently placed under close observation (<12 months). To date, she has achieved a CR of the primary lesion and cervical lymph nodes. In summary, we have described a case of successful treatment after chemotherapy for SNEC and have elucidated professional knowledge regarding the relevant aspects of SNEC.",

Radical surgery was performed to remove the tumor by open surgery. A biopsy was not performed prior to the surgery, so the tumor was diagnosed as end-stage primary liver cancer (PLC) based solely on the character and appearance of the tumor on computed tomography prior to surgery. However, subsequent to the surgery, upon analysis by the Department of Pathology, the mass was identified as an ovarian granulosa cell tumor (GCT). These tumors occur rarely, representing only 2-3% of all ovarian tumors, and are well known for late recurrences, with an incidence of 25-30%. As metastasis of the liver with GCT is extremely rare and the data available on the subject is limited by the small number of studies, and due to the absence of a biopsy report prior to surgery, the patient was initially misdiagnosed with PLC. However, despite this misdiagnosis, a good result was obtained, as the patient was later diagnosed with GCT following a detailed pathological examination and was treated with rational therapy. The performance status and quality of life were significantly improved, and the patient remains disease-free at one year post-surgery.",

A few cases have been reported in the literature with extreme invasiveness and a poor prognosis. However, there still have not been accepted criteria for diagnosis and treatment of LCNEC. Here we report an unmarried 37 year-old woman who was diagnosed with LCNEC associated with clear cell carcinoma and the tumor index was manifested with a specific increase of AFP. The case received six courses of etoposide and carboplatin chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy after primary curative surgery. However, she relapsed within 6 months after surgery and metastasized rapidly to distant organs despite combined chemotherapy of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bevacizumab, and died 18 months after primary surgery. This is the first reported case of LCNEC manifested with a specific increase of AFP and characteristically metastasized to the spine as recurrence. Reviewing our case as well as previously reported cases, LCNEC present with aggressive malignancy and vulnerable to distant metastasis through a hematogenous approach, we conjectured that adding Bevacizumab in primary chemotherapy may be beneficial to extend disease-free survival. But so far there is no recommendation of this regimen for treatment of LCNEC in current guidelines. Further research is needed to confirm this view so as to find the best treatment of LCNEC and improve the prognosis of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is highly resistant to current treatment strategies. High-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells with increased somatic mutations and genomic instability and the resulting heterogeneous mutant phenotypes are highly resistant to therapy. Plant-derived natural products, including Amla (Emblica officinalis) extract (AE), have demonstrated potent anti-neoplastic properties. Recently we demonstrated that AE inhibits cell growth and the expression of angiogenic factors in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 OC cells in vitro as well as in xenografts in vivo. The goal of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects of AE on carboplatinum- and taxol-resistant HGSOC cells carrying p53, BRCA1/2 mutations. Methods: Anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of AE on recently characterized carboplatinum- and taxol-resistant HGSOC cells (TOV3041G, OV866(2), OV4453 and, OV4485) was determined using the MTT, migration, invasion and spheroid assays in vitro. To understand the mechanism of AE-induced changes in angiogenesis-related hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), and EMT-associated SNAIL1 and E-cadherin proteins were studied using immunostaining and Western blotting. In vivo effects of AE were determined using mouse xenograft tumor model of OC developed by subcutaneous injection of OV4485 cells that carry mutant p53 and BRCA1, most aggressive and resistant among HGSOC cell lines used in this study. Tumor growth was measured using morphometry. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to determine changes in Ki67 (proliferation marker), CD31 (angiogenesis marker) as well as changes in HIF-1α, IGF1R, SNAIL1 and E-cadherin proteins. Results: AE significantly attenuated migration and invasiveness properties of all tested HGSOC cell phenotypes (P≤0.001), significantly reduced the expression of HIF-1α, IGF1R, and SNAIL1 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in all tested HGSOC cell lines (P=<0.05). Oral administration of AE for 4 weeks caused a significant regression of mouse xenograft tumor (>60%) that derived from OV4855 cells and decreased the expression of endothelial cell antigen-CD31, HIF-1α, IGF1R and SNAIL1 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in tumor tissues. Conclusions: AE sensitizes platinum- and taxol-resistant heterogenous HGSOC cells carrying mutations in p53, BRCA1/2 genes, and attenuates their malignant characteristics through targeting key signaling mechanisms of angiogenesis and metastasis. AE is a potential adjunct therapeutic agent for treating resistant, mutant, heterogenous OC.",

The Working Group for this guideline designated pfs, which is associated with symptom control, as a critical outcome. A finding of net benefit can therefore be concluded based on significant differences in pfs. However, that benefit is not without identified harms. Given the identified harms, patient involvement in the decision-making process must take into consideration the side effect profiles of olaparib and bevacizumab within the context of improved pfs but minimal change in os.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide but accounts for the highest mortality rate among these cancers. A stepwise approach to assessment, diagnosis, and treatment is vital to appropriate management of this disease process. An integrated approach with gynecologic oncologists as well as medical oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists is of paramount importance to improving outcomes. Surgical cytoreduction to R0 is the mainstay of treatment, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Genetic testing for gene mutations that affect treatment is the standard of care for all women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Nearly all women will have a recurrence, and the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer continues to be nuanced and requires extensive review of up to date modalities that balance efficacy with the patient's quality of life. Maintenance therapy with poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, bevacizumab, and/or drugs targeting homologous recombination deficiency is becoming more widely used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, and the advancement of immunotherapy is further revolutionizing treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we describe our experience with a recurrent ovarian cancer patient who was treated safely with bevacizumab and who achieved a complete response despite receiving nine prior chemotherapy regimens. The patient was a 54-year-old woman with stage IIIC recurrent ovarian serous adenocarcinoma (grade 3). Computed tomography (CT) revealed that no evidence of ascites, multiple intraperitoneal dissemination, or intrapelvic lymph node metastases was present. The absence of bowel obstruction and disseminated lesions involving the intestinal tract was confirmed by CT. Performance status was 0, and a blood test also indicated preservation of major organ function. In our hospital, weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab therapy (paclitaxel at 80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15; bevacizumab at 15/mg/kg on day 1 and every 21 days thereafter) was started. Eight cycles were administered, with no signs of gastrointestinal perforation, and the antitumor effect was evaluated as a complete response. The observed adverse events included grade 1 hyponatremia and grade 1 hypochloremia, and there was one grade 1 sensory peripheral neuropathy. These adverse events neither delayed treatment nor necessitated any dosage reductions. This case suggests that bevacizumab can be safely administered even to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received three or more prior chemotherapy regimens if there are neither symptoms of bowel obstruction nor lesions suggestive of intestinal invasion on diagnostic imaging.",

    "title": "The current role of secondary cytoreductive surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer represents worldwide the second most frequent and the most fatal gynecological malignancy, with approximately two thirds of the patients presenting with advanced disease. Cytoreductive surgery, primary or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients. Despite the improvement in quality of cytoreductive surgery as well as development of novel drugs and chemotherapy regimens, still most women with ovarian cancer will ultimately develop recurrent disease and die of their disease. In contrast to the management of primary disease, the standard treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer remains a topic of debate. While platinum-based or second line systemic chemotherapy, depending on the time after last platinum treatment, is standard of care, the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery has been a controversial issue for the last decades. Potential outcome benefit must be also weighed against the risk of severe surgical morbidity, impairment of quality of life and costs. In platinum-resistant recurrent disease, i.e., relapse after less than 6 months from the last platinum-based chemotherapy for primary disease, secondary cytoreduction seems generally not to be indicated due to its aggressive biological behavior and the absence of effective systemic treatment. In this comprehensive review, the current role of cytoreductive surgery in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer is discussed thoroughly in view of the results of most recent randomized trials and a meta-analysis. There seems to be definitely a role for secondary cytoreductive surgery in selected patients with ovarian cancer recurrence in whom complete resection of macroscopic disease is feasible. However, its role should be continuously reviewed due to the changing systemic treatment of patients with ovarian cancer recurrence over time.",

    "abstract": "So far, ovarian cancer has still been the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The chemotherapy and targeted medication are the mainstay for the recurrent ovarian cancer treatment. About 70% of the advanced-stage cases will relapse. Ascites-derived organoid is a pre-clinical model for the precise prediction of the therapeutic effectiveness for the ovarian cancer: it can be used to assess the drug sensitivity, to guide individualized precise treatment, and to improve advanced stage as well as recurrent ovarian cancer patient' survival and prognosis. Until now, there has been no report concerning the establishment of the organoid out of the patient's ascites and the concurrent usage of drug sensitivity test to guide the individualized precise treatment for the ovarian cancer. Here, we report a case of recurrent ovarian cancer of a 59-year-old female patient whose CA125 at its peak increased to 4523.4 U/mL. Then, patient's own ovarian cancer organoid was constructed from the ascites by the abdominocentesis; concurrently, medication sensitivity test was performed on the organoid to guide individualized precise treatment. After the treatment, CA125 decreased to 33.7 U/mL, and the patient's condition relieved effectively. This is the first published case report using ascites-derived organoid and the drug sensitivity test thereof to guide the precise treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Most patients with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and develop resistance to platinum-based agents. The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to visualize the platinum distribution in the ovarian cancer tissues at the time of interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 27patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Two distinct patterns of platinum distribution were observed. Type A (n = 16): platinum accumulation at the adjacent stroma but little in the tumor; type B (n = 11): even distribution of platinum throughout the tumor and adjacent stroma. The type A patients treated post-surgery with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly shorter periods of recurrence after the last platinum-based chemotherapy session (p = 0.020) and were diagnosed with \"platinum-resistant recurrence\". Moreover, type A was significantly correlated with worse prognosis (p = 0.031). Post-surgery treatment with non-platinum-based chemotherapy could be effective for the patients classified as type A. Our findings indicate that the platinum resistance can be predicted prior to recurrence, based on the platinum distribution; this could contribute to the selection of more appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, which may lead to improves prognoses.",

    "title": "Successful secondary radical operation on unretractable metastatic platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer by immunotherapy: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Although rechallenge with platinum-based chemotherapy is effective for most platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) patients, there is still a subset of patients who have no responses to the standard care. Overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) is a top priority in oncology clinics, but it remains intricate. It is difficult for clinicians to manage unretractable ROC when conventional therapy yields no results. The rational and effective use of immunotherapy will contribute to the clinical benefit of these patients, especially in patients without approved immunotherapy biomarkers. Here we present a case of successful secondary radical surgery for unretractable metastatic MDR ROC by immunotherapy based on her immune-infiltrating tumor microenvironment signatures.\n          \nA 57-year-old woman, diagnosed with IC2 stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer in 2015, underwent immediate ultra-radical cytoreductive surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. After nearly 37 months of disease-free status, the woman complained of spontaneous pain from the right subcostal margin for 1 month and was diagnosed with ROC accompanied by multiple unretractable colorectal and hepatic metastases. Standard chemotherapies were ineffective and quickly resulted in disease progression and grade IV myelosuppression followed impaired gastrointestinal function. Notably, after standard chemotherapy, the patient was tested negative for all immune biomarkers, but multiple fluorescence immunohistochemistry indicated that her tumor tissue was significantly infiltrated with the cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, implying potential benefits of immunotherapy. Then changed to 3 cycles of intravenous pembrolizumab, the main pelvic tumor and hepatic metastases showed significant shrinkage and achieved partial response, but the disease progressed after 8.7 months. Subsequently, arterial perfusion with pembrolizumab was performed combined with the chemotherapy. A comfortingly partial response was achieved again that enabled the patient to successfully undergo a secondary radical surgery for colorectal and liver metastases. Since that time the patient's postoperative course has been favorable, and she remains disease-free at present for at least 17 months.\n          \nImmune infiltration signatures of the tumor microenvironment could serve as an indication for immunotherapy in patients with unretractable platinum-sensitive ROC with MDR. In addition, the introduction of immunotherapy might bring some degree of chemotherapy resensitization.",

    "title": "Update on the secondary cytoreduction in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer: a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "The ovarian cancer recurrence occurs in 75% of patients with advanced FIGO stage, and its treatment is a challenge for the oncologist in gynecology. The standard treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) usually includes intravenous chemotherapy according to platinum sensitivity. Furthermore, maintenance treatment with target therapies [e.g., anti-angiogenic drug or PARP inhibitors (PARPi)], should be provided if not precedently administrated. In this scenario, secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) remains a practical but controversial option for platinum-sensitive ROC (PSROC). So far, several retrospective series and a Cochrane meta-analysis had concluded that SCS could determine better survival outcomes in ROC with favorable prognostic characteristics, such as the presence of a single anatomical site of recurrence, or when patients are accurately selected for surgery based on complete resection's predictive models. Recently, three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigated the role of SCS in PSROC patients selected with different criteria. All the three RCTs showed a significant statistical advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) in the SCS group, with an even more significant difference in patients with complete cytoreduction (about 7-month PFS increased). Data on overall survival (OS) are different in the two completed trials. The GOG213 study has documented a longer OS of PSROC patients who received chemotherapy alone compared to surgery plus chemotherapy. Contrarily, the DESKTOP III trial showed 7.7 months of increased OS in the surgery group vs. chemotherapy alone, with a more difference in the complete tumor cytoreduction (CTC) group (12 months). These RCTs thereby suggest that undergoing complete cytoreduction may not be the only key and that the disease biology may also matter. Few recent retrospective series investigated the role of SCS according to BRCA mutation status and the effect of SCS in patients receiving emerging PARPi. A consequence of the developments in SCS and knowledge of different molecular pathways influencing the recurrent disease is that the future research objective should be to individualize and personalize the surgical approach.",

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) with BRCA1/2 mutations exhibit improved outcome and sensitivity to double-strand DNA break (DSB)-inducing agents (i.e., platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors [PARPis]) due to an underlying defect in homologous recombination (HR). However, resistance to platinum and PARPis represents a significant barrier to the long-term survival of these patients. Although BRCA1/2-reversion mutations are a clinically validated resistance mechanism, they account for less than half of platinum-resistant BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOCs. We uncover a resistance mechanism by which a microRNA, miR-622, induces resistance to PARPis and platinum in BRCA1 mutant HGSOCs by targeting the Ku complex and restoring HR-mediated DSB repair. Physiologically, miR-622 inversely correlates with Ku expression during the cell cycle, suppressing non-homologous end-joining and facilitating HR-mediated DSB repair in S phase. Importantly, high expression of miR-622 in BRCA1-deficient HGSOCs is associated with worse outcome after platinum chemotherapy, indicating microRNA-mediated resistance through HR rescue.",

Here we report the activity of CHK1i in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with measurable and biopsiable disease (cohort 5), or without biopsiable disease (cohort 6). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes were safety and progression-free survival (PFS). 49 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled (24 in cohort 5, 25 in cohort 6). Among the 39 RECISTv1.1-evaluable patients, ORR was 33.3% in cohort 5 and 28.6% in cohort 6. Primary endpoint was not evaluable due to early stop of the trial. The median PFS was 4 months in cohort 5 and 6 months in cohort 6. Toxicity was manageable. Translational research was an exploratory endpoint. Potential biomarkers were investigated using pre-treatment fresh biopsies and serial blood samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed high levels of DNA replication-related genes (POLA1, POLE, GINS3) associated with lack of clinical benefit [defined post-hoc as PFS < 6 months]. Subsequent preclinical experiments demonstrated significant cytotoxicity of POLA1 silencing in combination with CHK1i in platinum-resistant HGSOC cell line models. Therefore, POLA1 expression may be predictive for CHK1i resistance, and the concurrent POLA1 inhibition may improve the efficacy of CHK1i monotherapy in this hard-to-treat population, deserving further investigation.",

Presented here is the case of an adult patient with NSCNEC of the ovaries associated with a deleterious BRCA2 germline mutation.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an adult BRCA2 germline mutation carrier with the rare NSCNEC of the ovary phenotype. Therefore, ovarian cancer patients with histological subtypes other than high-grade serous carcinomas should be tested for BRCA1/2 mutations, as they may benefit from targeted therapy with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors.",

We conducted a retrospective review of thirty-one unrelated patients found to be heterozygous for a germline pathogenic variant in ATM and identified a significant proportion of patients in this cohort with cancers not currently associated with the ATM hereditary cancer syndrome, including carcinomas of the gallbladder, uterus, duodenum, kidney, and lung as well as a vascular sarcoma. A comprehensive review of the literature found 25 relevant studies where 171 individuals with a germline deleterious ATM variant have been diagnosed with the same or similar cancers. The combined data from these studies were then used to estimate the prevalence of germline ATM pathogenic variants in these cancers, which ranged between 0.45% and 2.2%. Analysis of tumor sequencing performed in large cohorts demonstrated that the frequency of deleterious somatic ATM alterations in these atypical cancers equaled or exceeded the alteration frequency in breast cancer and occurred at a significantly higher rate than in other DNA-damage response tumor suppressors, namely BRCA1 and CHEK2. Furthermore, multi-gene analysis of somatic alterations in these atypical cancers demonstrated significant co-occurrence of pathogenic alterations in ATM with BRCA1 and CHEK2, while there was significant mutual exclusivity between pathogenic alterations in ATM and TP53. This indicates that germline ATM pathogenic variants may play a role in cancer initiation and progression in these atypical ATM malignancies, potentially influencing these cancers to be driven toward DNA-damage repair deficiency and away from loss of TP53. As such, these findings provide evidence for broadening of the ATM-cancer susceptibility syndrome phenotype to improve the recognition of affected patients and provide more efficacious, germline-directed therapies.",

    "abstract": "Given the rarity of RAD51C mutations, the risk and treatment of metachronous breast cancer after the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in RAD51C mutation carriers is not clear, especially for those who have received PARPi treatment. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with stage IIIC high-grade serous primary fallopian tube cancer. The patient had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The patient received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin and achieved a complete response. After interval debulking surgery, the patient received three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Collection and extraction of saliva DNA for next-generation sequencing identified a RAD51C mutation c.838-2 A > G. The patient received niraparib as front-line maintenance treatment. After 36 months of niraparib treatment, the patient had grade II invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast that was positive for estrogen receptor (90%) and Ki-67 (30%) and negative for progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Computed tomography revealed the absence of distant metastases. Modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were then performed. The final pathological report of the breast showed a 1.8 cm Bloom-Richardson grade II invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast with axillary lymph node metastasis (1/21). Finally, the breast cancer was stage IIA, pT1cN1M0. The metachronous breast cancer in this case may be the first report of second primary cancer in fallopian tube cancer patient harboring a RAD51C mutation during niraparib treatment. Further studies are required to determine optimal treatment.",

RAD51C is a less commonly studied ovarian cancer susceptibility gene whose promoter is sometimes methylated, leading to homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and PARPi sensitivity. For this study, the PARPi-sensitive patient-derived ovarian cancer xenograft PH039, which lacks HR gene mutations but harbors RAD51C promoter methylation, was selected for PARPi resistance by cyclical niraparib treatment in vivo. PH039 acquired PARPi resistance by the third treatment cycle and grew through subsequent treatment with either niraparib or rucaparib. Transcriptional profiling throughout the course of resistance development showed widespread pathway level changes along with a marked increase in RAD51C mRNA, which reflected loss of RAD51C promoter methylation. Analysis of ovarian cancer samples from the ARIEL2 Part 1 clinical trial of rucaparib monotherapy likewise indicated an association between loss of RAD51C methylation prior to on-study biopsy and limited response. Interestingly, the PARPi resistant PH039 model remained platinum sensitive. Collectively, these results not only indicate that PARPi treatment pressure can reverse RAD51C methylation and restore RAD51C expression, but also provide a model for studying the clinical observation that PARPi and platinum sensitivity are sometimes dissociated.",

    "abstract": "While poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have improved the prognosis of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) tumors that are homologous recombination (HR) deficient (HRD), new therapeutic strategies are needed for tumors that are HR proficient (HRP) because they demonstrate greater resistance to current treatments and thus have poorer clinical outcomes. Additionally, clinical precautionary statements regarding potential risks associated with PARPi, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, highlight the need for combinatorial approaches that can lessen the dose and duration of PARPi treatment to reduce toxicities. Here, we evaluated DNA double-strand damage repair pathways in HRD and HRP ovarian cancer cell lines and found that in HRD cell lines, PARPi therapy reduced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair, specifically due to decreased theta-mediated end-joining. The combination of PARPi with ATM serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (ATMi) suppressed both NHEJ and HR pathways in HRD and HRP cell lines, with synergistic increases in apoptosis and decreases in cell viability and colony formation. Interestingly, PARPi plus ATMi also decreased NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, which was not observed when PARPi was combined with inhibition of the ATR kinase (ATRi). These findings indicate that PARPi plus ATMi is a promising strategy for HGSC independent of underlying tumor HR status.",

    "abstract": "While therapies targeting deficiencies in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway are emerging as the standard treatment for high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients, this strategy is limited to the ~50% of patients with a deficiency in this pathway. Therefore, patients with HR-proficient tumors are likely to be resistant to these therapies and require alternative strategies. We found that the HR gene Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) is wildtype and its activity is upregulated in HGSOC compared to normal fallopian tube tissue. Interestingly, multiple pathways related to metabolism are inversely correlated with ATM expression in HGSOC specimens, suggesting that combining ATM inhibition with metabolic drugs would be effective. Analysis of FDA-approved drugs from the Dependency Map demonstrated that ATM-low cells are more sensitive to fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist that affects multiple cellular metabolic pathways. Consistently, PPARα signaling is associated with ATM expression. We validated that combined inhibition of ATM and treatment with fenofibrate is synergistic in multiple HGSOC cell lines by inducing senescence. Together, our results suggest that metabolic changes induced by ATM inhibitors are a potential target for the treatment of HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "Poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) has become an important maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer after surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapy, which has changed the disease management model of ovarian cancer, greatly decreased the risk of recurrence, and made the prognosis of ovarian cancer better to certain extent. The three PARPis currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of ovarian cancer are Olaparib, Niraparib and Rucaparib. With the incremental results from new clinical trials, the applicable population of PARPi for ovarian cancer have expanded to population with non-BRCA mutations. Although BRCA mutated population are still the main beneficiaries of PARPi, recent clinical trials indicated PARPis' therapeutic potential in non-BRCA mutated population, especially in homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) positive population. However, lack of unified HRD status detection method poses a challenge for the accurate selection of PARPi beneficiaries. The reversal of homologous recombination (HR) function during the treatment will not only cause resistance to PARPis, but also reduce the accuracy of the current method to determine HRD status. Therefore, the development of reliable HRD status detection methods to determine the beneficiary population, as well as rational combination treatment are warranted. This review mainly summarizes the latest clinical trial results and combination treatment of PARPis in ovarian cancer with non-BRCA mutations, and discusses the application prospects, including optimizing combination therapy against drug resistance, developing unified and accurate HRD status detection methods for patient selection and stratification. This review further poses an interesting topic: the efficacy and safety in patients retreated with PARPis after previous PARPi treatment---\"PARPi after PARPi\".",

Evidence from clinical trials to date has demonstrated that patients with a BRCAm derive the greatest benefit from PARP inhibitors. However, clinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors provide benefit to women with ovarian cancer who do not have a BRCAm. The recent updated approvals of olaparib, niraparib and rucaparib by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of all platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian-cancer populations, regardless of their BRCAm status, support this. Long-term tolerability and efficacy of olaparib have been demonstrated in patients both with and without a BRCAm, with 13% of patients receiving maintenance olaparib for at least 5 years in one study, which is unprecedented in the relapsed ovarian-cancer setting (versus 1% on placebo). Further studies should be performed to elucidate which non-BRCAm patients are deriving benefit and what molecular processes are enabling this, so that patients continue to receive optimal treatment for their disease. Here, we review clinical and molecular markers of HRD, the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer, with a focus on olaparib and the current approved indications for PARP inhibitors, as well as guidance on treatment decisions for patients with PSR ovarian cancer.",

No evidence is available so far on the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) in this population. Here, we report a 60-year-old female patient diagnosed with left ureter high-grade UC. Recurrent lesions were found 20 months after radical surgery. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed a slightly high-density soft tissue mass (3.2 × 3.1 cm) on the left posterior wall of the abdomen (waist), soft tissue mass adjacent to the left inner wall of the pelvis (3.2 × 4.2 cm), and multiple enlarged lymph nodes to the left of abdominal aorta. A next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based 605-gene panel detected a novel BRCA2 pathogenic germline mutation c.1670T>A (p.L557*), and a series of somatic insertion and deletion (INDEL) mutations of BRCA1, RB1, and JAK2, and single nucleotide variation (SNV) mutations of TP53, KMT2D, MET, ROS1, and IL7R.

In conclusion, this study proved for the first time that PARPi was effective for UC treatment in patients carrying germline BRCA2 pathogenic mutations, providing new treatment options for such patients. In addition, the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) test can be used for drug selection and response monitoring in UC treatment.",

    "title": "Synchronous ovarian metastasis from colorectal cancer: A report of two cases.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian metastasis of colorectal cancer is relatively rare. The present study reports two cases of synchronous ovarian metastasis from colorectal cancer, which were managed by cytoreductive surgery. In case one, a 60-year-old female patient presented with a multilocular pelvic tumor and ascites. Virtual colonoscopy revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon; however, no tumor cells were identified on histological examination. Ovarian metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer was suspected and adnexectomy was subsequently performed. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of the resected tumor revealed positive staining for cytokeratin (CK)20 and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and negative staining for CK7, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and inhibin. The immunohistological results supported the diagnosis of ovarian metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer. In case two, a 56-year-old female patient presented with a multilocular pelvic tumor and ascites. Colonoscopy identified a rectal tumor, and histological examination revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by cytological analysis of ascites. Subsequently, ovarian metastasis from rectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination was diagnosed, and left ovariectomy and transverse colostomy were performed. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemical investigation revealed positive staining for CK20 and CDX2, but negative staining for CK7. These immunohistological results indicated ovarian metastasis from rectal cancer. Both patients recovered well and are currently undergoing regular follow-up examinations. The observations from the two cases indicate that ovarian metastases of primary colorectal cancer may present as pelvic tumors and, thus, preoperative examination of the gastrointestinal tract is required. Furthermore, even in cases of widespread colorectal cancer metastases, excision of the ovarian tumor is required to establish a histological diagnosis for the selection of appropriate treatments.",

    "title": "High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and detection of inactivated BRCA genes from biopsy material of Slovak patients.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of mortality among all gynecological cancers in developed countries and its most common and most lethal type is the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). At the molecular level, nearly half of all HGSCs exhibit ineffective homologous DNA recombination and disruption of DNA damage/repair pathway inactivation caused often by BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. Recently, the detection of BRCA1/2 mutations became important for personalized treatment of HGSC patients with the PARP-inhibitors in the defined clinical setting of relapse after positive adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapeutic response. Based on the selection of patients by regional oncologists, we attempted to verify the possibilities of BRCA1/2 mutation testing on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy material from regional hospitals. In the study we used: a/ FFPE tumor resections of 97 patients sent to our laboratory, originally stored in archives of regional departments for a period of 1-3 years and retrieved on the principle to contain a maximum of non-necrotic tumor tissue, b/ next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay covering all known mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes on MiSeq (Illumina® platform), and c/ Sophia DDM® bioinformatics platform. After processing of FFPE samples, 5 cases were excluded due to the insufficient genomic DNA quantity. Bioinformatics results of NGS analyses of 92 patients' samples indicated 17.39% pathogenic mutations and 32.61% potentially pathogenic mutations in genes BRCA1/2. Overall, 50% pathogenic and potentially pathogenic mutations were detected in the patient's cohort. The relatively high incidence of BRCA1/2 mutations in our series may be influenced by various indicators including the selection of patients based on adjuvant therapy response as well as regional or population heterogeneity in their frequency. Based on the interdisciplinary cooperation, the use of archival biopsy material processed primarily and stored for a longer period in different laboratories without uniformly defined pre-analytical conditions allows identifying the HGSC patients who might better respond to the PARP-inhibition therapy.",

We report a rare case of a 45-year-old female patient who clinically presented an isolated right inguinal lymphadenopathy. The remaining clinical examination was normal. Therefore, an excisional biopsy of the lymph node was performed. Pathological analysis revealed a high-grade serous carcinoma, most likely of gynecological origin. Due to histological evidence, a computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out. There was no CT evidence of ovarian disease, pelvic involvement, intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies, metastatic disease, or ascites. All tumor markers were negative. The patient underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by surgical staging. Surprisingly, pathological examination showed a STIC lesion in the fimbria of the left fallopian tube.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the real-world, long-term prognostic impacts, and adverse effects (AEs) of bevacizumab (BEV) in Asian patients with ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancers. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients with ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancer on front-line chemotherapy with or without BEV (Cohort 1) and those who relapsed following chemotherapy and/or BEV (Cohort 2) between 2011 and 2018 in a tertiary medical centre. Patient characteristics, BEV dosages, clinical outcomes, and AEs were analyzed. Hazard ratios for disease progression and death were analyzed using a cox proportional regression model. Benefits of BEV used throughout triweekly, in terms of improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), were observed at a dosage of 7.5-15 mg/kg among advanced-stage Cohort 1 patients. A progression-free interval of <6 months was the strongest predictor of disease progression and death in advanced-stage patients. BEV throughout and optimal cytoreduction were independent predictors of reduced disease progression. No prognostic advantage was observed between serous and clear cell histologies when BEV was added. Moreover, BEV resulted in improved OS in Cohort 2 patients, especially in the platinum-sensitive subgroup. Most patients had a front-line BEV dosage <10 mg/kg per cycle with <10 treatment cycles. Low rates and grades of BEV-related AEs were observed in both cohorts. BEV used throughout effectively extended PFS and OS in advanced-stage patients with ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancer. Patients with platinum-sensitive carcinoma, treated with BEV, had a significant improvement in OS and extended PFS. Therefore, BEV can safely be added to chemotherapy for ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancers.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 50% of tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas (HGSCs) have functional homologous recombination-mediated (HR) DNA repair, so-called HR-proficient tumors, which are often associated with primary platinum resistance (relapse within six months after completion of first-line therapy), minimal benefit from poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and shorter survival. HR-proficient tumors comprise multiple molecular subtypes including cases with CCNE1 amplification, AKT2 amplification or CDK12 alteration, and are often characterized as \"cold\" tumors with fewer infiltrating lymphocytes and decreased expression of PD-1/PD-L1. Several new treatment approaches aim to manipulate these negative prognostic features and render HR-proficient tumors more susceptible to treatment. Alterations in multiple different molecules and pathways in the DNA damage response are driving new drug development to target HR-proficient cancer cells, such as inhibitors of the CDK or P13K/AKT pathways, as well as ATR inhibitors. Treatment combinations with chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors and agents targeting DNA replication stress have shown promising preclinical and clinical results. New approaches in immunotherapy are also being explored, including vaccines or antibody drug conjugates. Many approaches are still in the early stages of development and further clinical trials will determine their clinical relevance. There is a need to include HR-proficient tumors in ovarian cancer trials and to analyze them in a more targeted manner to provide further evidence for their specific therapy, as this will be crucial in improving the overall prognosis of HGSC and ovarian cancer in general.",

    "abstract": "Background: As a major subtype of ovarian cancer, high grade FIGO stage IIIc serous ovarian carcinoma (HG3cSOC), has various prognosis due to genetic heterogeneity. Methods: The transcriptome of 401 primary FIGO IIIc serous ovarian samples was screened, seven genes based prognostic model was developed. The prognostic valueof risk score in four different cohorts (TCGA-cohort, Poland-cohort, Japan-cohort and USA-cohort) was validated. The relationship between risk score and other clinical indicators were analyzed. The guide value of risk score for platinum-taxol chemotherapy was also assayed. Tissue microenvironment difference among samples with different risk scores was investigated. Results: High-risk group (N=200, median survival months: 39.6, 95% CI: 35.9-46.3 months) had a significantly worse prognosis than low-risk group (N=201, median survival months: 52.6, 95% CI: 45.2-64.9 months;). The risk score's performance was validated in Japan-cohort (N=90, Poland-cohort (N=48) and USA-cohort (N=84). The risk score is independent from age, primary tumor size, grade and treatment methods and the performance of risk score is uniform in subgroups. Furthermore, the risk score predicted the response of HG3cSOC to platinum-based regimen after surgery, and this finding was further validated in newly collected China-cohort (N=102). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and tumor infiltration analysis revealed that risk score reflected the immune infiltration and cell-cell interaction status, and the migration function of candidate genes were also verified. Conclusions: The optimized seven genes-based model is a valuable and robust model in predicting the survival of HG3cSOC, and served as a valuable marker for the response to platinum-based chemotherapy.",

Although platinum-based chemotherapy has been the cornerstone for HGSOC treatment, nearly 25% of patients would have less than 6 months of interval since the last platinum chemotherapy, referred to as platinum-resistance. Currently, no precise tools to predict platinum resistance have been developed yet.\n          \nNinety-nine HGSOC patients, who have finished cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy in Peking University Third Hospital from 2018 to 2019, were enrolled. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) were performed on the collected tumor tissue samples to establish a platinum-resistance predictor in a discovery cohort of 57 patients, and further validated in another 42 HGSOC patients.\n          \nA high prevalence of alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway, including BRCA1/2, was identified both in the platinum-sensitive and resistant HGSOC patients. Compared with the resistant subgroup, there was a trend of higher prevalence of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) in the platinum-sensitive subgroup (78.95% vs. 47.37%, p=0.0646). Based on the HRD score, microhomology insertions and deletions (MHID), copy number changes load, duplication load of 1-100 kb, single nucleotide variants load, and eight other mutational signatures, a combined predictor of platinum-resistance, named as DRDscore, was established. DRDscore outperformed in predicting the platinum-sensitivity than the previously reported biomarkers with a predictive accuracy of 0.860 at a threshold of 0.7584. The predictive performance of DRDscore was validated in an independent cohort of 42 HGSOC patients with a sensitivity of 90.9%.\n          \nA multi-genomic signature-based analysis enabled the prediction of initial platinum resistance in advanced HGSOC patients, which may serve as a novel assessment of platinum resistance, provide therapeutic guidance, and merit further validation.",

    "abstract": "The high frequency of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is the main rationale of testing platinum-based chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), however, the existing methods to identify HRD are controversial and there is a medical need for predictive biomarkers. We assess the in vivo response to platinum agents in 55 patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of TNBC to identify determinants of response. The HRD status, determined from whole genome sequencing, is highly predictive of platinum response. BRCA1 promoter methylation is not associated with response, in part due to residual BRCA1 gene expression and homologous recombination proficiency in different tumours showing mono-allelic methylation. Finally, in 2 cisplatin sensitive tumours we identify mutations in XRCC3 and ORC1 genes that are functionally validated in vitro. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the genomic HRD is predictive of platinum response in a large cohort of TNBC PDX and identify alterations in XRCC3 and ORC1 genes driving cisplatin response.",

Consequently, there is urgent need for the development of increasingly reliable HRD tests, overcoming present limitations, as they play a key role in the diagnostic and therapeutic process as well as have a prognostic and predictive value. In this review we offer an overview of the state of the art regarding the actual knowledge about BRCA and HRD mutational status, the rationale of PARPi use and HRD testing (current and in development assays) and their implications in clinical practice and in the treatment decision process, in order to optimize and choose the best tailored therapy in patients with ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is not a single disease and can be subdivided into at least five different histological subtypes that have different identifiable risk factors, cells of origin, molecular compositions, clinical features and treatments. Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of different metastatic patterns of stage III high-grade serous ovarian cancer on the patient prognosis. The clinical data of 134 patients with Stage III, high-grade serous ovarian cancer diagnosed in The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University from January 2018 to April 2020 were retrospectively collected, and the patients were grouped according to metastasis mode. Patients with simple lymph node metastasis (SLNM) were included in the SLNM group, and patients with simple abdominal implantation alone and patients with abdominal metastasis combined with lymph node metastasis were all in the abdominal metastasis (AM) group. The prognosis of the two groups was analyzed. Of the 134 enrolled patients, complete datasets from 128 were successfully collected. There were 20 cases of SLNM (15.63%) and 108 cases of AM (84.37%). Initial CA125, initial HE4, and whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used were compared between the two groups (P < 0.05). According to the chemotherapy results, patients was divided into two groups: chemotherapy remission and uncontrolled, including 111 patients with chemotherapy remission and 17 patients with uncontrolled chemotherapy. According to the criteria of relapse after complete completion of chemotherapy and clinical remission, 91 cases relapsed, 20 cases did not relapse, of which 78 cases were platinum-sensitive, and 13 were platinum-resistant relapses. There were 4 recurrence cases in SLNM group (4.40%) and 87 recurrence cases (95.60%) in AM group (P < 0.05). The recurrence sites of 91 patients were analyzed, including 52 cases (57.14%) in the peritoneum, 11 cases (12.09%) in distant regions, 9 cases (9.89%) in lymph nodes, 19 cases (20.88%) in the peritoneum and lymph nodes. Significant differences were noted in the two groups' peritoneum, lymph node, and distance (P < 0.05). The two groups had significant differences in progression-free survival, overall survival, and 3-year survival (all P < 0.05). Initial HE4 levels, chemotherapy sensitivity, and SLNM are independent prognostic factors for Stage III high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. Initial HE4 level < 233.7 pmol/l and chemotherapy sensitivity were protective factors, indicating a good prognosis. Patients in the SLNM group had lower initial CA125 and HE4 levels and higher survival rates. Initial HE4 levels and chemotherapy sensitivity are independent factors affecting prognosis in Stage III high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to platinum compounds is a major determinant of patient survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). To understand mechanisms of platinum resistance and identify potential therapeutic targets in resistant HGSOC, we generated a data resource composed of dynamic (±carboplatin) protein, post-translational modification, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from intra-patient cell line pairs derived from 3 HGSOC patients before and after acquiring platinum resistance. These profiles reveal extensive responses to carboplatin that differ between sensitive and resistant cells. Higher fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathway expression is associated with platinum resistance, and both pharmacologic inhibition and CRISPR knockout of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), which represents a rate limiting step of FAO, sensitize HGSOC cells to platinum. The results are further validated in patient-derived xenograft models, indicating that CPT1A is a candidate therapeutic target to overcome platinum resistance. All multiomic data can be queried via an intuitive gene-query user interface (https://sites.google.com/view/ptrc-cell-line).",

    "title": "Risk Factors of Hypersensitivity to Carboplatin in Patients with Gynecologic Malignancies.",
    "abstract": "We evaluated the prevalence of and risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions related to carboplatin, which is commonly used to treat gynecological malignancies. All women with pathologically documented ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer treated with carboplatin alone or a carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimen at a single hospital between January 2006 and December 2013 were retrospectively recruited. We analyzed the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, management, and outcomes of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions among these patients. Among 735 eligible women, 75 (10.2%) experienced a total of 215 carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reaction events. The annual incidence of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions gradually increased from 0.88% in 2006 to 5.42% in 2013. The incidence of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity was higher in patients with advanced stage disease (P < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test), serous and mixed histological types (P = 0.003, Kruskal-Wallis test), malignant ascites (P = 0.009, chi-square test), and history of other drug allergy (P < 0.001, chi-square test). Compared to women without hypersensitivity reactions, women who experienced hypersensitivity reactions had a significantly greater median cycle number (12 vs. 6, P < 0.001, independent sample t-test) and dose (6,816 vs. 3,844 mg, P < 0.001, independent sample t-test). The cumulative incidence of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions dramatically increased with >8 cycles or dose >3,500 mg. Therefore, disease severity, histological type, malignant ascites, past drug allergies, and cumulative carboplatin dose are risk factors for carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions. Such reactions could potentially be reduced or prevented by slowing the infusion rate and using a desensitization protocol involving anti-allergy medications.",

    "abstract": "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image-based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n = 394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n = 284 and n = 136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model's decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "About 20% of patients with high grade serous epithelial ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) are intrinsically resistant to standard first-line platinum-based combination therapy. There is no marker yet available to identify these patients. In that context, all patients with HGSOC initially receive the same standard first-line platinum-based therapy, and those with intrinsically resistant diseases can only be identified retrospectively after they experienced early relapse to therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate serum or ascites CA125 and ascites leptin in patients with intrinsic resistance and to compare them with those of sensitive patients. To this end, we enrolled 80 women with HGSOC who underwent cytoreductive surgery. Thirty seven were considered to have baseline clinical resistance to first-line therapy with progression-free survival < 6 months despite treatment. Serum were collected preoperatively and ascites samples were collected at the time of the surgery. The levels of CA125 and leptin were measured by ELISA. Patients with baseline clinical resistance to first-line therapy had a significantly poorer outcome compared to patients with sensitive HGSOC with an OS of 21 months versus 43 months. Median levels of serum CA125, ascites CA125 and ascites leptin were not significantly different between patients with sensitive and resistant HGSOC. Serum CA125/ascites leptin ratio was found to be significantly elevated in resistant patients compared to patients with drug-sensitive diseases. In ROC analysis, the AUC for serum CA125/ascites leptin ratio was higher than CA125 or leptin alone to differentiate patients with resistance from those with sensitive HGSOC. Elevated serum CA125/ascites leptin ratio was a predictor of poor OS in HGSOC patients. Thus, serum CA125/ascites leptin is a potential novel biomarker to predict baseline clinical resistance to first-line treatment and poor outcome in patients with HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) comprises series of interrelated pathways that repair double-stranded DNA breaks and inter-strand crosslinks. It provides support for DNA replication to recover stalled or broken replication forks. Compared with homologous recombination proficiency (HRP), cancers with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) are more likely to undergo cell death when treated with DNA-damaging agents, such as platinum agents, and have better disease control.\n          \nPatients diagnosed with stage III/IV ovarian cancer, early stages with recurrence, who received adjuvant chemotherapy after debulking surgery, and who also had known HR status were eligible.\n          \nForty-four patients were included, with 21 in the HRD group (including 8 with germline mutations) and 23 in the HRP group. The HRD group was composed predominantly of serous carcinoma (95.2%), while mucinous (n=3) and clear cell (n=1) cases were all found in the HRP group. Stage III/IV disease was 66.7% and 91.3% in HRD and HRP groups, respectively (p=0.064). Patients who were optimally debulked to no residual disease was 90.0% and 72.7% (p=0.243), respectively. Late line use of PARP inhibitors was 33.3% and 17.4% (p=0.303). Median PFS was 22.5 months (95% CI, 18.5 - 66.6) and 21.5 months (95% CI, 18.3-39.5) (p=0.49) in HRD and HRP respectively. Median platinum free interval (PFI) was 15.8 months (95% CI 12.4-60.4) and 15.9 months (95% CI 8.3-34.1) (p=0.24), respectively. Median OS was 88.2 months (95% CI 71.2-NA) and 49.7 months (95% CI 35.1-NA) (p=0.21). The PFS of the patients with germline BRCA mutations (n=5) was 54.3 months (95% CI 23.1-NA) and 21.5 months (95% CI 18.3-39.5) in the HRP group (p=0.095); the PFI difference was 47.7 months (95% CI 17.6-NA) in the BRCA mutation group, and 15.9 months (95% CI 12.4-60.4) in HRP, showing statistical significance (p=0.039); while the median OS was NA and 49.7 months (95% CI 35.1-NA) respectively (p=0.051). When adding two additional patients with somatic BRCA mutations to the germline BRCA mutation carriers, the median OS is NA (95% CI 73, NA) versus 49.7 months (95% CI 35.1, NA) for HRP (p=0.045).\n          \nHRD status was not associated with longer PFS or PFI in advanced ovarian cancer who received first line adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.

    "abstract": "This study aims to identify differentially expressed proteins related with platinum sensitivity and to find biomarkers for predicting platinum response and survival outcomes in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Eligible HGSOC patients were divided into platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant groups according to platinum-free interval (PFI). Tissue protein lysates from tumor tissues were subjected to an in-solution tryptic digest followed by tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling of the resulting peptides and mass spectrometric analysis. Candidate proteins were identified using differentially expressed protein and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and their survival relevance was evaluated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer cohort. The results showed that there was a significant difference in the protein expression profiling between the two patient groups. In the GSEA model, a gene set of 239 extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins was significantly enriched in the platinum-sensitive group [normalized enrichment score (NES) = 3.82, q < 10-5], and this finding was confirmed in TCGA ovarian cancer cohort. Interestingly, an ECM-related gene expression, serpin family A member 10 (SERPINA10), was identified to be significantly positively correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in TCGA ovarian cancer cohort (all p < 0.05). IHC results demonstrated that HGSOC patients with high SERPINA10 expression had longer PFI than the patients with low SERPINA10 expression (9 vs. 5 months, p = 0.038), and the SERPINA10 expression had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.758 (95% CI = 0.612-0.905; p = 0.005) to discriminate the platinum-sensitive group from the platinum-resistant group. In conclusion, the results suggested that SERPINA10 could be a promising biomarker for predicting the response and survival in platinum-based chemotherapy of HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "A woman in her 60s was evaluated for anterior chest pain. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 50 mm mass with irregular contrast enhancement in the anterior mediastinum. α-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated to 1188 ng/mL. A germ cell tumor was diagnosed, mostly comprising of a yolk sac tumor (YST). Two courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP16) were administered and surgical tumor resection was then performed. The final diagnosis was YST. CDDP and VP16 were continued postoperatively; however, because the AFP level increased about six months after surgery, the chemotherapy regimen was altered to bleomycin and CPT-11. As the AFP again increased and a CT scan revealed tumor re-enlargement, recurrent YST was diagnosed and radiotherapy was administered. The patient received a total of 60 Gy (2 Gy per fraction). The tumor started to shrink during radiotherapy and AFP levels decreased. By one month post-radiotherapy, AFP levels had normalized and the tumor had disappeared. As of six years after radiotherapy, the patient remains alive without recurrence. Mediastinal YSTs are rare, and treatment usually includes surgery and preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens. Successful treatment with radiotherapy has occasionally been reported. Our patient showed recurrence of a YST after surgery and chemotherapy, but achieved long-term survival after radiotherapy. Few patients with YST have undergone radiotherapy, but this approach was successful in our patient. In cases of postoperative recurrent YST resistant to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, together with salvage surgery, may offer a valuable option.",

Its diagnosis and treatment are controversial.It is still controversial whether malignant mural nodules represent a dedifferentiated form of mucinous tumors or collisional tumors. This is a case report of a 32-year-old female diagnosed with ovarian mucinous tumor recurred as a mucinous carcinoma combined with sarcomatoid and undifferentiated sarcoma mural nodules after surgery and chemotherapy. The primary lesion did not have a sarcomatous component after comprehensive sampling and repeated review, while the recurrent lesion had a predominantly sarcomatous component. The patient received a second operation and postoperative chemotherapy plus Anlotinib with no progression at 16 months of follow-up. Primary mucinous carcinoma and sarcomatous mural nodules revealed the same K-RAS mutation(c.35G>T, pG12V), TP53 mutation (c.817C>T, p.R273C), MLL2 mutation(c.13450C>T, p.R4484) and NF1 mutation(c.7876A>G, p.S2626G). We present a comprehensive analysis on morphologic characteristics, molecular detection results, clinical management, and prognosis of ovarian mucinous tumors with mural nodules of sarcomatoid and undifferentiated sarcoma. Mutation sharing between primary mucinous carcinoma and recurrent sarcomatous nodules supports monoclonal origin of primary and recurrent tumors, suggesting a tendency for sarcomatous differentiation during the progression of epithelial tumors. Malignant mural nodules represent dedifferentiation in mucinous ovarian tumors rather than collision of two different tumor types. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct comprehensive sampling, rigorous clinical examination, and postoperative follow-up in order to thoroughly evaluate all mural nodules of ovarian mucinous tumors due to their potential for malignancy and sarcomatous differentiation.",

    "abstract": "In this multicenter, open-label, single-arm, Phase II study with Simon two-stage optimum design (NCT04361370), we investigate the efficacy and safety of triplet maintenance (olaparib, pembrolizumab, bevacizumab) in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who are wild-type for BRCA 1/2. A total of 44 patients were enrolled, and the median follow-up duration was 22.9 months (interquartile range: 17.4-24.7). The primary outcome was 6-months progression-free survival (PFS), which was 88.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.4-96.2), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. The secondary outcomes reported here include median PFS, 12-months PFS, and overall survival and safety. The median PFS was 22.4 months (20.4-∞), with a 12-months PFS rate of 84.0% (95% CI 69.3-92.0). The median overall survival was 28.6 months (27.3-∞). The combination demonstrated tolerable toxicity with manageable side effects. Other secondary outcomes include time-to-progression, time to subsequent treatment, time to second treatment and PFS2; however, this data is not reported, as treatment is still ongoing in a majority of patients. Exploratory analysis shows that patients who were homologous recombination deficiency-positive or had a programmed death-ligand 1 combined positive score ≥1 showed a favorable response (P = 0.043 and P < 0.001, respectively). Thus, triplet maintenance shows durable efficacy with tolerable safety in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence.",

Due to lack of standard guidelines, the treatment strategies of these diseases are controversial. Here, we share two cases of YSTs originating from the endometrium and the broad ligament respectively and review related literature. A 35-year-old woman was diagnosed with endometrial YST in our center and underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy with BEP (bleomycin, cisplatin and etoposide) regimen for six courses. After follow-up for 21 months, there is still no evidence of relapse. Another 36-year-old woman was admitted to our department with YST of the broad ligament. She was treated with surgery followed by chemotherapy with BEP regimen and was lost to follow-up after completing therapy. The case of endometrial YST we shared was similar to cases reported before, while the case with YST of the broad ligament we shared was the second case reported worldwide. Both of these two cases were treated with surgery combined with chemotherapy with BEP regimen.",

    "abstract": "More than 10% of women diagnosed with breast cancer during reproductive age carry hereditary germline pathogenic variants in high-penetrance BRCA genes or in others genes involved in DNA repair mechanisms such as PALB2, BRIP or ATM. Anticancer treatments may have an additional negative impact on the ovarian reserve and subsequently on the fertility of young patients carrying such mutations. Recently, the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel is being recommended to these BRCA-mutated patients as neoadjuvant therapy. However, the impact on the ovary is unknown. Here, we investigated their effect of on the ovarian reserve using mice carriers of BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase-1 (BRIP1) mutation that plays an important role in BRCA1-dependent DNA repair. Results revealed that the administration of carboplatin or paclitaxel did not affect the ovarian reserve although increased DNA double-strand breaks were observed with carboplatin alone. Co-administration of carboplatin and paclitaxel resulted in a significant reduction of the ovarian reserve leading to a lower IVF performance, and an activation of the PI3K-Pten pathway, irrespective of the genetic background. This study suggests that co-administration of carboplatin and paclitaxel induces cumulative ovarian damage and infertility but a heterozygote genetic predisposition for DNA damage related to BRCA1 gene function does not increase this risk.",

    "title": "Postchemotherapy sarcoma as a somatic-type malignancy derived from the gonadal yolk sac tumor in a patient with 46, XY pure gonadal dysgenesis.",
    "abstract": "46, XY pure gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) is characterized as a female phenotype with strip-like gonads, which has a high tendency to develop into gonadal tumors. Somatic-type malignancies of germ cell tumors (SMs of GCTs) refer to the presence of malignant non-germ cell histologies admixed with GCTs, which are usually chemoresistant and indicate poor prognosis. This case report aimed to analyze the special histological type of GCTs and the importance of salvage surgery in the treatment of refractory GCTs. We report a unique case of gonadal yolk sac tumor (YST) transformed into SMs in a patient with 46, XY PGD. This 18-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic pelvic tumor resection, considered her first surgery, 2 years ago, and pathology revealed YST with initial alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level measuring >3,000 ng/mL. She underwent seven cycles of chemotherapy, and the AFP level decreased to within a normal range after the second cycle. However, a computed tomography scan after the seventh cycle revealed abdominal and pelvic metastases, and vaginal bleeding was continuously observed. Laparoscopic exploration and laparotomy with tumor subtotal resection were performed. A pathology report showed SMs (sarcoma) derived from YST. Whole exome sequencing demonstrated that the main somatic mutation was a non-synonymous mutation of KRAS (c.182A>G), and this result did not show any indications for targeted drugs. She received three cycles of PEI (cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide) chemotherapy but showed no response. She refused to undergo further treatment and has been alive with the disease for 7 months. This suggests that SMs may be one of the reasons for chemoresistance of refractory GCTs, and salvage surgery may be one of the most effective treatments for this patient. Targeted therapy may be a new choice for chemoresistant GCTs, but drug selection must be based on gene sequencing, and its efficacy still needs to be verified by further study.",

    "abstract": "Background: Limited evidence exists on the impact of adding a taxane, using endocrine therapy and carrying a deleterious germline BRCA mutation on ovarian reserve measured by anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) levels of young breast cancer patients receiving (neo)adjuvant cyclophosphamide- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Methods: This is a biomarker analysis including young (≤ 40 years) early breast cancer patients with known germline BRCA mutational status and available prospectively collected frozen plasma samples before and after chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of either six cycles of FEC (5 fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 100 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) or three cycles of FEC followed by three cycles of docetaxel (D, 100 mg/m2). Endocrine therapy consisted of tamoxifen (±GnRH agonists). AMH levels at baseline, 1 and 3 years after diagnosis were compared according to type of chemotherapy (FEC only vs. FEC-D), use of endocrine therapy (yes vs. no) and deleterious germline BRCA mutations (mutated vs. negative). Results: Out of 148 included patients, 127 (86%) received D following FEC chemotherapy, 90 (61%) underwent endocrine therapy, and 35 (24%) had deleterious germline BRCA mutations. In the whole cohort, AMH levels drastically dropped 1 year after diagnosis (p < 0.0001) with a slight but significant recovery at 3 years (p < 0.0001). One year after diagnosis, patients treated with FEC only had higher median AMH levels than those who received FEC-D (0.22 vs. 0.04 μg/L, p = 0.0006); no difference was observed at 3 years (0.06 and 0.18 μg/L, p = 0.47). Patients under endocrine therapy had significantly higher AMH levels than those who did not receive this treatment 1 year after diagnosis (0.12 vs. 0.02 μg/L; p = 0.008), with no difference at 3 years (0.11 and 0.20 μg/L, p = 0.22). AMH levels were similar between BRCA-mutated and BRCA-negative patients at baseline (1.94 vs. 1.66 μg/L, p = 0.53), 1 year (0.09 vs. 0.06 μg/L, p = 0.39) and 3 years (0.25 vs. 0.16 μg/L; p = 0.43) after diagnosis. Conclusions: In breast cancer patients receiving FEC chemotherapy, adding D appeared to negatively impact on their ovarian reserve in the short-term; no further detrimental effect was observed for endocrine therapy use and presence of a deleterious germline BRCA mutation.",

The treatment of patients with persistent, refractory, or platinum-resistant MOGCT is not well defined. The objective of this case report was to analyze the importance of chemotherapy, salvage surgery and target therapy in the treatment of a patient with refractory OGCT after first-line chemotherapy failure. We reported a 34 year-old woman suffered from advanced refractory MOGCT after first-line chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and a series of chemotherapy. The genetic test shows she is a carrier of EGFR: p.L858R mutation. Based on genetic testing result, she received icotinib which targeted for EGFR mutation, but the tumor progressed. After a secondary cytoreductive surgery, she exhibited a partial response and continued to receive chemotherapy. This suggests that salvage surgery may be considered for patients with persistent or refractory MOGCTs when no effective systemic treatment option is available. Targeted therapies based on gene sequencing may provide a new option; however, its efficacy and related resistance mechanisms still need to be verified by further study.",

    "abstract": "Metastases to the spleen from various non-hematologic malignancies are generally not a common clinical event and usually indicate the late dissemination of disease. Solitary splenic metastases from solid neoplasm are extremely uncommon. Furthermore, solitary metastasis to the spleen from primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is extremely rare and has not been reported previously. We report a case of isolated splenic metastasis in a 60-year-old woman, occurring 13 months after a total hysterectomy, a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, a pelvic lymphadenectomy, a para-aortic lymphadenectomy, an omentectomy, and an appendectomy were performed for PFTC. The patient's serum tumor marker CA125 was elevated to 49.25 U/ml (N < 35.0 U/ml). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 4.0 × 3.0 cm low-density lesion in the spleen that was potentially malignant, with no lymphadenectasis or distant metastasis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic exploration, and one lesion was found in the spleen. Then, a laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) confirmed a splenic metastasis from PFTC. The histopathological diagnosis showed that the splenic lesion was a high-differentiated serous carcinoma from PFTC metastasis. The patient recovered for over 1 year, with no tumor recurrence. This is the first reported case of an isolated splenic metastasis from PFTC. This case underlines the importance of serum tumor marker assessment, medical imaging examination, and history of malignancy during follow-up, and LS seems to be the optimal approach for isolated splenic metastasis from PFTC.",

While tumor analysis did not confirm loss of heterozygosity, evidence suggests that BRCA1 haploinsufficiency also increases genomic instability and cancer risk. After pre-phase treatment and the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient developed prolonged pancytopenia leading to neutropenic sepsis. Subsequent cycles showed a shorter duration of pancytopenia, though it remained significant. A literature review indicates that BRCA1 deficiency may impair bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy, as observed in breast cancer patients, which we hypothesize also applies in this case. After first-line treatment, the patient had a partial response. In case of recurrence, the use of PARP inhibitors should be considered due to the BRCA1 deficiency.",

    "title": "Fatal Myelotoxicity Following Palliative Chemotherapy With Cisplatin and Gemcitabine in a Patient With Stage IV Cholangiocarcinoma Linked to Post Mortem Diagnosis of Fanconi Anemia.",
    "abstract": "Unrecognized genome instability syndromes can potentially impede the rational treatment of cancer in rare patients. Identification of cancer patients with a hereditary condition is a compelling necessity for oncologists, giving varying hypersensitivities to various chemotherapeutic agents or radiation, depending on the underlying genetic cause. Omission of genetic testing in the setting of an overlooked hereditary syndrome may lead to unexpected and unbearable toxicity from oncological standard approaches. We present a case of a 33-year-old man with an early-onset stage IV intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, who experienced unusual bone marrow failure and neutropenic fever syndrome as a consequence of palliative chemotherapy containing cisplatin and gemcitabine, leading to a fatal outcome on day 25 of his first chemotherapeutic cycle. The constellation of bone marrow failure after exposure to the platinum-based agent cisplatin, the presence of an early-onset solid malignancy and the critical appraisal of further phenotypical features raised suspicion of a hereditary genome instability syndrome. Whole-exome sequencing from buccal swab DNA enabled the post mortem diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, most likely linked to the fatal outcome due to utilization of the DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin. The patient's phenotype was exceptional, as he never displayed significant hematologic abnormalities, which is the hallmark of Fanconi anemia. As such, this case stresses the importance to at least question the possibility of a hereditary basis in cases of relatively early-onset malignancy before defining an oncological treatment strategy.",

    "title": "Inherited heterozygous Fanconi anemia gene mutations in a therapy-related CMML patient with a rare",
    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) genes play critical roles in the repair of DNA lesions. Non-FA (or underlying FA) patients harboring heterozygous germline FA gene mutations may also face an increased risk of developing bone marrow failure, primary immunodeficiency disease, and hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. We report a female patient who suffered from ovarian cancer at 50 years of age. During the initial treatment, six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin (DC) combination chemotherapy were administered followed by two cycles of docetaxel maintenance therapy. Then, she received a routine follow-up every 3 months for the next 3 years, and all the results of the examination and laboratory tests were normal. Unfortunately, at 54 years of age, she developed a secondary cancer of therapy-related (t-) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (t-CMML). After two courses of a highly intensive induction chemotherapy regimen with DAC (decitabine) and HAA (homoharringtonine, cytarabine), the patient suffered from severe and persistent bone marrow failure (BMF). Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of 80 genes was performed on her initial bone marrow aspirate sample and identified PTPN11, NRAS, and DNMT3A somatic mutations. In addition, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed a rare NUP98-HOXC11 fusion. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) verified RAD51C, BRIP1, PALB2, and FANCG heterozygous germline mutations of the FA pathway, which were further confirmed in buccal swab samples by Sanger sequencing. For this patient, we hypothesized that an altered FA pathway resulted in genomic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA-crosslinking agents or cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, and unsuccessful DNA damage repair. Consequently, she developed ovarian cancer and secondary t-CMML and then suffered from BMF and delayed post-chemotherapy bone marrow recovery after several chemotherapy courses. This case highlights the importance of genetic counseling in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms with high clinical suspicion for carrying cancer susceptibility gene mutations, which require timely diagnosis and personalized management.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer is the most aggressive subtype of mammary carcinoma. In the early stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is the standard of care for prognostic stratification and the best adjuvant treatment strategy. A 30-year-old female presented in the emergency room because of a gigantic right breast associated with an ulcerated lump at the upper quadrants. The right axillary nodes were palpable. An ultrasound was performed, showing the ulcerated neoformation with enlarged right axillary lymph nodes observed to level III. A core biopsy of the breast lesion was performed, and the pathological examination revealed a nonspecial type, grade 3, invasive, triple-negative breast cancer. No distant disease was found in the PET-CT scan. A germline genetic panel by next-generation sequencing identified a likely pathogenic variant in RAD51D (c.898C>T). Assessment of the functionality of the DNA homologous recombination repair pathway by RAD51 foci in the tumor revealed a profile of homologous recombination deficiency. NAC consisting of weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide was performed with a complete metabolic response achieved in the PET-CT scan. The patient underwent a modified radical mastectomy plus axillary lymphadenectomy with a pathological complete response in the breast and axilla and remains disease-free after 2 years of follow-up. We report a young female with a triple-negative breast cancer stage cT4bN3M0 and a hereditary pathogenic mutation in RAD51D. The tumor was highly proliferative and homologous recombination-deficient by RAD51. The patient received platinum-based NAC, achieving a pathologic complete response. More effort should be made to identify predictive functional biomarkers of treatment response, such as RAD51 foci, for platinum sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies demonstrated that homologous repair deficiency (HRD) score is a useful marker for response to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy. We determined HRD scores and elucidated the clinicopathologic characteristics of HRD-high tumors and their response to non-platinum-based chemotherapy. Primary breast cancer patients (n = 120) were pre-operatively treated with paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide (P-FEC). Germline and somatic homologous recombination related gene mutations (gHRRm and sHRRm, respectively) and HRD scores were analyzed using whole exome sequencing (WES) in tumor tissues obtained before chemotherapy. Of 120 tumors, 30 were determined to be HRD-high tumors, significantly associated with high Ki-67 (P = 0.014), ER negativity (P = 0.007), and PR negativity (P = 0.021). Triple-negative cancers showed significantly higher HRD scores than the luminal, luminal-HER2, and HER2 subtypes (P = 0.023, 0.016, and 0.033, respectively). HRD scores were significantly higher in tumors with gHRRm than in those with sHRRm (P = 0.002) or wild-type HRR genes (P = 1.44e-4), but no significant difference was found in HRD scores between tumors with sHRRm and wild-type HRR genes (P = 0.206). HRD-high tumors had significantly (P = 0.003) higher pCR rates and higher near-pCR rates (P = 0.049) compared with those of the HRD-low tumors in all tumors and the luminal subtype, respectively. HRD-high tumors were associated with aggressive phenotypes and gHRRm, but not sHRRm. Our findings suggested that HRD scores might be useful in predicting response to P-FEC in the luminal subtype.",

The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics disease stage was IIIc. In addition, the patient presented with urination and defecation difficulties. The result of tumor marker detection showed a carcinoembryonic antigen level of 348.2ng/ml, a cancer antigen 125 level of 2,091 U/ml and a cancer antigen 19-9 level of 113 U/ml. Computed tomography (CT) indicated and ovarian cystic or solid package, enlargement of multiple abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes and abdominal cavity effusion. Positron emission tomography/CT indicated multiple internal organ metastases. The center of the ovarian cystic or solid package was considered to be a malignant tumor. A large amount of ascites were detected, as well as abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis. The patient was treated with BIMRT at a total dose of 48 Gy, administered as a single 4.0-Gy dose 12 times. In addition, 100 mg cisplatin was administered as a peritoneal perfusion, followed by two cycles of 180 mg Taxol and 100 mg cisplatin. Furthermore, the enlargement of the lymph nodes was reduced and the tumor in the region of the ovary had decreased in size by 90%. The ascites had disappeared and the abdominal pain was greatly improved. At the time of writing this manuscript, the patient was well and without relapse. Therefore, modern radiotherapy techniques, such as BIMRT, may be considered as a beneficial treatment option for ovarian cancer patients with multiple peritoneal metastases in whom surgery is not suitable.",

There is also very strong concordance in copy number between diagnosis and relapse, with no significant difference in purity, ploidy or focal somatic copy number alterations, even when stratified by platinum sensitivity or prior chemotherapy lines. Copy number signatures are strongly correlated with immune cell infiltration, whilst diagnosis samples from patients with primary platinum resistance have increased rates of CCNE1 and KRAS amplification and copy number signature 1 exposure.

    "abstract": "The most common subtype of ovarian cancer (OC) is the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), accounting for 70%-80% of all OC deaths. Although HGSOC is a potentially immunogenic tumor, clinical studies assessing the effectiveness of inhibitors of programmed death protein and its ligand (PD-1/PD-L1) in OC patients so far showed only response rates <15%. However, recent studies revealed an interesting prognostic role of plasma PD-1/PD-L1 and other circulating immunoregulatory molecules, such as the B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), butyrophilin sub-family 3A/CD277 receptors (BTN3A), and butyrophilin sub-family 2 member A1 (BTN2A1), in several solid tumors. Since evidence showed the prognostic relevance of pretreatment serum CA125 levels in OC, the aim of our study was to investigate if soluble forms of inhibitory immune checkpoints can enhance prognostic power of CA125 in advanced HGSOC women. Using specific ELISA tests, we examined the circulating PD-1, PD-L1, pan-BTN3As, BTN3A1, BTN2A1, and BTLA levels in 100 advanced HGSOC patients before treatment, correlating them with baseline serum CA125, age at diagnosis, body mass index (BMI), and peritoneal carcinomatosis. A multivariate analysis revealed that plasma BTN3A1 ≤4.75 ng/ml (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.23-3.07; p=0.004), age at diagnosis ≤60 years (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.59; p=0.03) and absence of peritoneal carcinomatosis (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.66-4.22; p<0.0001) were independent prognostic factors for a longer progression-free survival (PFS) (≥30 months) in advanced HGSOC women. However, further two-factor multivariate analyses highlighted that baseline serum CA125 levels >401 U/ml and each soluble protein above respective concentration cutoff were covariates associated with shorter PFS (<30 months) and unfavorable clinical outcome, suggesting that contemporary measurement of both biomarkers than CA125 only could strengthen prognostic power of serum CA125 in predicting PFS of advanced HGSOC women. Plasma PD-L1, PD-1, BTN3A1, pan-sBTN3As, BTN2A1, or BTLA levels could be helpful biomarkers to increase prognostic value of CA125.",

Although most PD-L1 results were concordant, 5/24 and 6/24 pairs exhibited discordant results when stained with the E1L3N and 22C3 clones, respectively. Lastly, CD147 overexpression was found more often in the metastatic rather than the matched primary HGSOCs stained with CD147, though the difference was not significant.\n          \nCytology from effusions could be considered for biomarker testing when present, even when tissue from the primary cancer is also available and adequately cellular, as it could provide additional information of potential clinical significance.",

    "abstract": "Pleural effusion metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma with dedifferentiation is a rare clinical presentation. We present the case of a 78-year-old female patient who developed chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough without an obvious cause over the past two weeks. Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed consolidation of the right lung with massive pleural effusion. Cytological examination of pleural effusion revealed malignant tumor cells. Cell wax block analysis showed that the tumor was a nested, papillary, and single-cell structure, and epithelioid cell atypia was obvious. Nuclear grooves or intranuclear pseudoinclusion bodies were not observed. Immunohistochemical results were negative for thyroglobulin (TG) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), partially positive for paired box gene 8 antigen(PAX-8), and a Ki-67 proliferation index of 30%. Further immunohistochemical tests were positive for Braf-V600E and Ber-EP4, and the thyroglobulin serologic test was 265.90 µg/mL. The patient had undergone cervical lymph node dissection for right papillary thyroid cancer 21 years ago, developed lung metastases 4 years ago, and received targeted therapy. This case reminds us that metastatic pleural effusion tumors with atypical pathological morphology and immunohistochemical expression should be comprehensively evaluated in combination with clinical, immunohistochemical, and serological tests, which may help in the diagnosis and treatment of clinicians and pathologists.",

    "title": "Beside P53 and PTEN: Identification of molecular alterations of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas to determine potential novel therapeutic targets.",
    "abstract": "Despite great histological and molecular heterogeneity, the clinical management of high-grade ovarian carcinomas remains unspecialized. As a major subgroup, high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) require novel therapies. In addition to utilizing conventional histological prognostic markers and performing oncogenetic investigations, the molecular diagnostic method of next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify 'druggable' targets that could provide access to innovative therapy. The present study was performed in 45 HGSOC patients (mean age, 59.1 years; range, 25-87 years) with histologically proven HGSOC. Breast cancer 1/2 (BRCA1/2) germline mutations were screened in 17 patients with a familial or personal history of cancer, which was justified by oncogenetic investigations. Tumor protein 53 (P53) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression were assessed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry. Somatic mutations of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA) and MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) were screened using NGS on DNA extracts from frozen tumor specimens obtained at diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 6-93 months), 20 patients are alive, 10 patients are disease-free and 14 patients progressed within 6 months following platinum-based therapy. P53 overexpression was detected in 67% of patients and PTEN loss was detected in 38% of the patients. The overexpression of mutant P53 was found to be associated with a longer progression-free and overall survival. In total, 2 NRAS (exon 3), 3 PIK3CA (exon 5 and 10) and 5 MET mutations (exons 14 and 18) were detected. In HGSOCs, in addition to P53 and PTEN alterations, somatic genetic abnormalities can be detected using NGS and provide molecular rationale for targeted therapies, potentially offering novel therapeutic opportunities to patients.",

    "title": "Severe thrombocytopenia induced by niraparib in ovarian cancer patients: a case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a common gynecological malignancy, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) maintenance therapy has significantly prolonged the survival of newly diagnosed or platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer patients, which has become a new treatment paradigm for ovarian cancer. Niraparib is a widely used PARP inhibitor in the clinical setting, and its adverse effects are also a major concern. The common adverse reactions of Niraparib mainly include various hematological adverse reactions (such as thrombocytopenia and anemia), gastrointestinal adverse reactions (such as nausea and vomiting), and fatigue. In previous related reports, thrombocytopenia has been mentioned multiple times, a relatively common adverse reaction of Niraparib. However, there have been no reports of irreversible and persistent thrombocytopenia. This case report describes a 59-year-old woman who developed persistent thrombocytopenia 11 months after adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IIIC high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Despite various treatment measures, the patient's platelet count continues to fluctuate and remains low. This is a severe thrombocytopenia that may rare adverse reaction caused by Niraparib. This article adds important information to the scientific literature on potential serious adverse reactions in long-term treatment with Niraparib. It emphasizes the necessity of closely monitoring platelet counts during Niraparib treatment.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory-markers of the systemic inflammatory-response, such as neutrophil/lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) have been studied as prognostic factors in several tumors but in OC-patients their role is still controversial and no data about the possible correlation with the BRCA-status has been ever reported. We consecutively enrolled a series of 397 newly diagnosed high-grade serous-advanced OC-patients. All patients were tested for BRCA-mutational-status and blood-parameters have been collected 48 h before staging-surgery. A significant correlation of NLR with disease distribution (p < 0.005) was found and patients with NLR < 4 underwent primary-debulking-surgery more frequently (p-value 0.001), with a lower surgical-complexity-score (p-value 0.002). Regarding survival-data, patients with NLR < 4 had a significant 7-month increase in mPFS (26 vs 19 months, p = 0.009); focusing on the BRCA-status, among both BRCA-mutated and BRCA-wild type patients, those with lower NLR had a significantly prolonged mPFS compared to patients with NLR > 4 (BRCA-mutated: 35 vs 23 months, p = 0.03; BRCA-wt: 19 vs 16 months, p = 0.05). At multivariate-analysis, independent factors of prolonged PFS were BRCA mutational status, having received complete cytoreduction and NLR < 4. Also, the strongest predictors of longer OS were BRCA-mutational status, having received complete cytoreductive surgery, NLR < 4 and age. NLR is confirmed to be a prognostic marker in OC-patients and it seems unrelated with BRCA-mutational status.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is an approved predictive biomarker for Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in ovarian cancer. However, the proportion of positive HRD in the real world and the relationship between HRD status and PARPi in Chinese ovarian cancer patients remain unknown. A total of 67 ovarian cancer patients who underwent PARPi, either olaparib or niraparib, were enrolled and passed inclusion criteria from August 2018 to January 2021 in the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. HRD status correlation with Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed and summarized with a log-rank test. Univariate and multiple cox-regression analyses were conducted to investigate all correlated clinical factors. Approximately 68.7% (46/67) patients were HRD positive and the rest 31.3% (21/67) were HRD negative. The PFS among HRD-positive patients was significantly longer than those HRD-negative patients (medium PFS 9.4 m vs 4.1 m, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52, 95% CI: [0.38-0.71], p <0.001). Univariate cox-regression found that HRD status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, BRCA status, previous treatment lines, secondary cytoreductive surgery and R0 resection were significantly associated with PFS after PARPi treatment. After multiple regression correction, HRD status and ECOG were the independent factors to predict PFS (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: [0.49-0.92], p = 0.01; HR: 2.20, 95% CI: [1.14-4.23], p = 0.02, respectively). In platinum sensitivity evaluable subgroup (N = 49), HRD status and platinum sensitivity status remain significant to predict PFS after multiple regression correction (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: [0.51-0.98], p = 0.04; HR: 0.49, 95% CI: [0.24-1.0], p = 0.05, respectively). This is the first real-world study of HRD status in ovarian cancer patients in China, and we demonstrate that HRD is an independent predictive biomarker for PARP inhibitors treatment in Chinese ovarian cancer patients.",
