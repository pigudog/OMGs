    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a special pathological type of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and has a high prevalence in Asia without specific molecular subtype classification. Endometriosis is a recognized precancerous lesion that carries 3-fold increased risk of OCCC. Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, which also originates from endometriosis, shares several features with OCCC, including platinum resistance and younger age at diagnosis. Patients with OCCC have about a 2.5 to 4 times greater risk of having a venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with other EOC, and OCCC tends to metastasize through lymphatic vesicular and peritoneal spread as opposed to hematogenous metastasis. There is only mild elevation of the conventional biomarker CA125. Staging surgery or optimal cytoreduction combined with chemotherapy is a common therapeutic strategy for OCCC. However, platinum resistance commonly portends a poor prognosis, so novel treatments are urgently needed. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are currently being studied, including PARP, EZH2, and ATR inhibitors combined with the synthetic lethality of ARID1A-dificiency, and MAPK/PI3K/HER2, VEGF/bFGF/PDGF, HNF1β, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Advanced stage, suboptimal cytoreduction, platinum resistance, lymph node metastasis, and VTE are major prognostic predictors for OCCC. We focus on update pathogenesis, diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches to provide future directions for clinical diagnosis and treatment of OCCC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, and most patients experience recurrence after primary treatment. Currently, there is no standard treatment option for recurrent OCCC. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old female patient with OCCC. The patient received primary cytoreductive surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and remained disease-free for four months. She then experienced retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence and was treated with liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy followed by secondary debulking surgery. The patient experienced a second relapse in the lower left lung 11 months later. Genomic profiling of tumor samples revealed a deleterious AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) mutation and homologous recombination deficiency. Thus, the triplet combination of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib; the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab; and the antiangiogenic agent, bevacizumab was administered. The patient achieved partial response, which was sustained for 12 months. Our study provides the first clinical evidence that the combination of olaparib with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab could be an effective treatment for patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent OCCC.",

    "abstract": "NUCOLL43 is a novel ovarian clear cell carcinoma (O-CCC) cell line that arose from a primary culture of a patient's malignant ascites. The cells grow reliably in cell culture with a doubling time of approx. 45 hours and form colonies at high efficiency. They have a very high degree of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting approximately 85% of the genome, mostly copy neutral and almost identical to the original tumor. The cells express epithelial (pan-cytokeratin) and mesenchymal (vimentin) characteristics, CA125 and p16, like the original tumor. They also express ARID1A but not HNF-1β and, like the original tumor, and are negative for p53 expression, with no evidence of p53 function. NUCOLL43 cells express all other DNA damage response proteins investigated and have functional homologous recombination DNA repair. They are insensitive to cisplatin, the PARP inhibitor rucaparib, and MDM2 inhibitors but are sensitive to camptothecin, paclitaxel, and NVP-BEZ235. The NUCOLL43 cell line represents a distinct subtype of O-CCC that is p53 and HNF-1β null but expresses ARID1A. Its high degree of similarity with the original tumor genomically and proteomically, as well as the high level of LOH, make this an interesting cell line for O-CCC research.

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a rare type of epithelial ovarian cancer characterized by a chemoresistant phenotype and high-grade tumor. Conventional therapies for OCCC include surgery and chemotherapy. However, these OCCC treatment approaches are characterized by a high risk of relapse and drug resistance resulting in poor prognosis. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches are required to achieve better outcomes. In this study, a PIK3CA p.R88Q mutation and PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score of 10% was explored in a patient who presented with rapid recurrence after surgery and unsuccessful postoperative chemotherapy. Based on the clinical condition and the patient preference, she was administered a novel combinatorial therapy comprising mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which is a well-known and potent inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and the anti-PD-1 antibody toripalimab. Treatment with this combinatorial therapy showed good prognosis, with more than eight months of disease control, and no severe adverse events were observed. The findings of this study provide a novel and effective strategy for OCCC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a new combination regimen of immunotherapy (everolimus plus toripalimab) for solid tumors. Everolimus is not only an antitumor targeted drug but also an immunosuppressant; it's combination with immunotherapy is controversial. This is the first report to demonstrate that it has a synergistic effect.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) is rare, occurring approximately in 1% of women with ovarian endometriosis. The main histological types are endometrioid adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), with the latter being the least common.\n          \nIn our hospital, we recently summarized two patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma with similar characteristics. They all had endometriosis for a long time and had undergone ovarian cyst removal due to a chocolate cyst. Unfortunately, the cyst recurred after surgery, and the histological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. In case 1, the expression of P53 was found in the tumor by regular examination, and the stage was IIB. In Case 2, we found it in intraoperative freezing; the stage was IA. Case 1 has been treated with the TP regimen six times, and the survival period has reached one year. Case 2 had a survival period of 6 years after completing six TP regimen treatments. Clinicians should pay attention to patients with a long history of endometriosis and postoperative recurrence of ovarian cysts accompanied by serum CA-125 of more than 200U/mL. Imaging examination has a good prospect in diagnosing malignant transformation of endometriosis, especially PET-CT.\n          \nThis case report highlights the risk factors related to the formation of ovarian clear cell carcinoma and suggests that the follow-up of patients with ovarian endometriosis is essential because of its recurrence characteristics.

Here, we present the case of a patient with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) who failed to respond to multiline chemotherapy and target therapy but achieved an immune complete response (iCR) with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor treatment. The overall survival (OS) was 59 months, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 34 months after immunotherapy, which was counting. Meantime, molecular testing results revealed that traditional biomarkers for immunotherapy, including PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB), were negative. HLA-B44 (B*18:01) supertype was confirmed by sequence-based HLA typing.

    "abstract": "This retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nedaplatin plus paclitaxel (NP) compared with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (CP) in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients with histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer with recurrent interval ≥6 months after finishing platinum-based therapies between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014 were investigated. Patients received an intravenous infusion of NP (nedaplatin 80 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) or CP (carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) protocols every 3 weeks for at least 6-8 cycles or until disease progression. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were toxicity and overall survival (OS). 436 patients were included in the study, containing 241 cases receiving CP regimen and 195 cases receiving NP regimen, who were all contained in safety analysis. Because of 61 patients with unbearable toxicity and poor compliance, 375 patients were finally included in the efficacy analysis. With median follow-up of 63.5 months, PFS was 11.0 months with NP regimen versus 9.5 months with CP regimen (P=0.109). Subgroup analysis indicated that PFS of the NP arm was statistically superior to the CP arm when recurrent interval was 6-12 months (P=0.048); median PFS was 10.0 versus 8.0 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall survival between two groups. More frequent grade 3-4 neutropenia (13.3% vs 33.6%), thrombocytopenia (5.6% vs 14.5%) and hypersensitivity reactions (5.6% vs 21.9% ) were observed in CP arm (P<0.01). Compared to the CP, NP regimen did not improve 5-year overall survival in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, but it had better tolerance. NP obtained significant benefit in progression-free survival when the recurrent interval was between 6 and 12 months, although the efficacy of two regimens were similar when the recurrent interval ≥12 months.",

While treatment with carboplatin enriches for CA125-negative cells, co-treatment with carboplatin and birinapant eliminates these cells in HGSCs expressing high levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein cIAP in the CA125-negative population. Birinapant sensitizes CA125-negative cells to carboplatin by mediating degradation of cIAP causing cleavage of caspase 8 and restoration of apoptosis. This co-therapy significantly improves disease-free survival in vivo compared with either therapy alone in tumour-bearing mice. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies that target CA125-negative cells may be useful in the treatment of HGSC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma has a high recurrence rate with poor prognosis and is generally not sensitive to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. Its less frequent occurrence of mutations such as BRCA limited the targeted therapies. Immunotherapy is not currently recommended as a first-line agent for ovarian cancer, and most patients are not yet able to benefit from it. Cryoablation can be used to treat solid systemic tumors, including ovarian cancer metastases, and can produce a limited anti-tumor immune response. The anti-tumor effects of cryoablation combined with immunotherapy have not been adequately confirmed. This study reports a case of a patient with ovarian clear cell carcinoma who underwent conventional adjuvant chemotherapy after initially surgical resection of the tumor. Unfortunately, cancer recurred and metastasized to the abdominal wall. After a series of painful chemotherapy and a second surgery, the cancer was still not effectively controlled, and the patient developed extensive metastases in the lung. The patient's PD-L1 expression level also did not support solo immunotherapy. We pioneered the use of cryoablation to first eradicate the most significant lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung and then combined it with the PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab to treat the patient with immunotherapy, which resulted in the complete eradication of the other multiple metastases in the lung and saved the patient's life. Although the precise mechanism of action has not yet been explored, we have reason to believe that the combination of cryoablation and immune checkpoint inhibitor has a powerful synergistic anti-tumor effect, which is yet to be confirmed by more basic research and clinical applications in the next step.",

In this study, surgically resected samples were collected from 44 patients with OCCC. Genomic alterations were determined using next-generation sequencing. HRD was estimated by genomic instability. Of 44 patients with OCCC, two (4.5%) harbored likely pathogenic mutations in HRR genes. Notably, no pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were found in BRCA1/2. A total of 24 variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in HRR-related genes occurred in 18 (40.9%) patients. HRD was observed in only one case (2.3%). In addition, TP53 mutation and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) were identified in three patients (6.8%) and in one patient (2.3%), respectively. TP53 mutation was significantly associated with disease-free survival and overall survival. No POLE mutations were found. In conclusion, our results revealed a very low prevalence of HRR gene mutations and HRD in OCCC. Moreover, TP53 mutations and MSI-H are uncommon, while POLE mutations are extremely rare in OCCC. Our findings indicate that the evaluation of HRR gene mutations, HRD status, POLE mutations, and MSI-H may have limited clinical significance for OCCC treatment and prognostic stratification.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway deficiency (HRD) is involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) as well as in the sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy drugs. In this study, we obtained data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) on HGSOC and identified scores for the loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance, and large-scale state transitions, and calculated the HRD score. We then investigated the relationships among the score, genetic/epigenetic alterations in HRR-related genes, and the clinical data. We found that BRCA1/2 mutations were enriched in the group with HRD scores ≥63. Compared with the groups with scores ≤62, this group had a good prognosis; we thus considered HRD scores ≥63 to be the best cutoff point for identifying HRD cases in HGSOC. Classification of HGSOC cases by the HRD status revealed a better prognosis for HRD cases caused by genetic alterations (genetic HRD) than those caused by epigenetic changes and those caused by undetermined reasons (p = 0.0002). Among cases without macroscopic residual tumors after primary debulking surgery, 11 of 12 genetic HRD cases survived after the median observation period of 6.6 years, showing remarkably high survival rates (p = 0.0059). In conclusion, HGSOC can be classified into subtypes with different prognoses according to HRD status. This classification could be useful for personalized HGSOC treatment.",

Prognosis is generally poor, and no treatment guidelines are offered. Here, we report a case of OSCCHT successfully treated by complete excision and a postoperative chemotherapy scheme of carboplatin and paclitaxel. A 29-year-old female with with pelvic mass and significantly increased serum calcium (4.90 mmol/L) was referred to our hospital on August 22, 2013. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a pelvic nonhomogeneous echo of a 113×102 mm mass, possibly coming from the adnexa of the uterus. Preoperative examinations indicated high levels of serum calcium and relevant acute renal dysfunction; hence, continuous renal replacement therapy was performed until all tests reached minimum operation requirements. Interestingly, after excision, serum calcium levels decreased rapidly and therefore, extra calcium had to be taken in order to take the level back up to normal. The patient was diagnosed with OSCCHT based on the clinical data and pathological examinations. After six cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was in a good condition and on follow-up there were no signs of recurrence.",

    "title": "Novel biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of ovarian clear cell carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma can arise from endometriosis; however, it is distinct from other types of epithelial ovarian carcinoma in terms of its clinicopathological and molecular features. Cancer antigen 125 lacks the sensitivity and specificity required for accurate clinical diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Therefore, the aim of the current review was to identify novel biomarker candidates for the immunohistochemical and serological diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. A search of the relevant English language literature published between 1966 and 2014 was conducted using the PubMed MEDLINE online database. High-throughput tissue microarray technology and proteomic screening combined with mass spectrometry may provide additional information regarding diagnostic biomarker candidates for ovarian clear cell carcinoma. The present review summarizes the characteristics of potential genomic alterations that activate cancer signaling pathways and, thus, contribute to carcinogenesis. The major signaling pathways activated in clear cell carcinoma are associated with cell cycle regulation (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 and tumor protein D52), growth factor signaling (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1; KiSS-1 metastasis-suppressor; erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2; and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2), anti-apoptosis and survival pathways [sialidase 3 (membrane sialidase)], metabolism (γ-glutamyltransferase 1), chemoresistance (napsin A aspartic peptidase, glutathione peroxidase 3; and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A1), coagulation [coagulation factor III (thromboplastin, tissue factor); and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2], signaling (lectin, galactoside-binding and soluble, 3), and adhesion and the extracellular matrix [cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (epithelial); versican; and laminin, α 5]. The present review of the relevant literature may provide a basis for additional clinical investigation of the ovarian clear cell carcinoma serum biomarker candidate proteins identified herein.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer with distinct pathological features, molecular profiles, and biological functions. OCCC has high incidence rates in East Asia compared to the Western hemisphere and Europe and is associated with endometriosis. With its relative resistance to conventional treatment regimens and the worst stage-adjusted prognosis among ovarian cancer subtypes, there is an urgent need to optimize therapeutic options and to improve patient outcomes. To achieve this goal, better patient stratification strategies are required. These strategies could derive from comprehensive and in-depth multidimensional analysis of tumor heterogeneity. Understanding intertumor heterogeneity could assist us in stratifying OCCC patients based on features that are prognostic or predictive. Recent genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling analyses allow us to provide an integrative perspective on the diverse heterogeneity in OCCC that could pave the way for novel translational research and clinical development in the future.",

Multiple metastases of SNEC are even more rare, and patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease generally face a poor outcome. To date, only a few cases of SNEC have been reported. Here, we describe a rare case of a 70-year-old female patient with SNEC of the tonsil who presented with multiple metastases and had achieved a complete response (CR) of the primary lesion and cervical lymph nodes for more than 1 year after receiving palliative chemotherapy. Initially, the patient presented with a 2-month history of throat pain. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography revealed a soft mass with moderate enhancement on the left tonsil, which was confirmed by incisional aspiration biopsy. She was additionally sent for a positron emission tomography scan to evaluate small metastases in the left cervical lymph node, right lung, multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, and the fourth lumbar (L4) vertebra body metastases. Histopathological examination of the SNEC confirmed a nested, typical endocrine appearance with small round cells containing ovoid-shaped nuclei and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 8/18+, synaptophysin+, CD56+, and Ki-67 (<50%). The patient received 6 cycles of cisplatin combined with etoposide and was subsequently placed under close observation (<12 months). To date, she has achieved a CR of the primary lesion and cervical lymph nodes. In summary, we have described a case of successful treatment after chemotherapy for SNEC and have elucidated professional knowledge regarding the relevant aspects of SNEC.",

Radical surgery was performed to remove the tumor by open surgery. A biopsy was not performed prior to the surgery, so the tumor was diagnosed as end-stage primary liver cancer (PLC) based solely on the character and appearance of the tumor on computed tomography prior to surgery. However, subsequent to the surgery, upon analysis by the Department of Pathology, the mass was identified as an ovarian granulosa cell tumor (GCT). These tumors occur rarely, representing only 2-3% of all ovarian tumors, and are well known for late recurrences, with an incidence of 25-30%. As metastasis of the liver with GCT is extremely rare and the data available on the subject is limited by the small number of studies, and due to the absence of a biopsy report prior to surgery, the patient was initially misdiagnosed with PLC. However, despite this misdiagnosis, a good result was obtained, as the patient was later diagnosed with GCT following a detailed pathological examination and was treated with rational therapy. The performance status and quality of life were significantly improved, and the patient remains disease-free at one year post-surgery.",

A few cases have been reported in the literature with extreme invasiveness and a poor prognosis. However, there still have not been accepted criteria for diagnosis and treatment of LCNEC. Here we report an unmarried 37 year-old woman who was diagnosed with LCNEC associated with clear cell carcinoma and the tumor index was manifested with a specific increase of AFP. The case received six courses of etoposide and carboplatin chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy after primary curative surgery. However, she relapsed within 6 months after surgery and metastasized rapidly to distant organs despite combined chemotherapy of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bevacizumab, and died 18 months after primary surgery. This is the first reported case of LCNEC manifested with a specific increase of AFP and characteristically metastasized to the spine as recurrence. Reviewing our case as well as previously reported cases, LCNEC present with aggressive malignancy and vulnerable to distant metastasis through a hematogenous approach, we conjectured that adding Bevacizumab in primary chemotherapy may be beneficial to extend disease-free survival. But so far there is no recommendation of this regimen for treatment of LCNEC in current guidelines. Further research is needed to confirm this view so as to find the best treatment of LCNEC and improve the prognosis of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Background: Ovarian cancer (OC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is highly resistant to current treatment strategies. High-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cells with increased somatic mutations and genomic instability and the resulting heterogeneous mutant phenotypes are highly resistant to therapy. Plant-derived natural products, including Amla (Emblica officinalis) extract (AE), have demonstrated potent anti-neoplastic properties. Recently we demonstrated that AE inhibits cell growth and the expression of angiogenic factors in OVCAR3 and SKOV3 OC cells in vitro as well as in xenografts in vivo. The goal of this study was to determine the anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects of AE on carboplatinum- and taxol-resistant HGSOC cells carrying p53, BRCA1/2 mutations. Methods: Anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic effects of AE on recently characterized carboplatinum- and taxol-resistant HGSOC cells (TOV3041G, OV866(2), OV4453 and, OV4485) was determined using the MTT, migration, invasion and spheroid assays in vitro. To understand the mechanism of AE-induced changes in angiogenesis-related hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGF1R), and EMT-associated SNAIL1 and E-cadherin proteins were studied using immunostaining and Western blotting. In vivo effects of AE were determined using mouse xenograft tumor model of OC developed by subcutaneous injection of OV4485 cells that carry mutant p53 and BRCA1, most aggressive and resistant among HGSOC cell lines used in this study. Tumor growth was measured using morphometry. Immunostaining and Western blotting were used to determine changes in Ki67 (proliferation marker), CD31 (angiogenesis marker) as well as changes in HIF-1α, IGF1R, SNAIL1 and E-cadherin proteins. Results: AE significantly attenuated migration and invasiveness properties of all tested HGSOC cell phenotypes (P≤0.001), significantly reduced the expression of HIF-1α, IGF1R, and SNAIL1 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in all tested HGSOC cell lines (P=<0.05). Oral administration of AE for 4 weeks caused a significant regression of mouse xenograft tumor (>60%) that derived from OV4855 cells and decreased the expression of endothelial cell antigen-CD31, HIF-1α, IGF1R and SNAIL1 and increased the expression of E-cadherin in tumor tissues. Conclusions: AE sensitizes platinum- and taxol-resistant heterogenous HGSOC cells carrying mutations in p53, BRCA1/2 genes, and attenuates their malignant characteristics through targeting key signaling mechanisms of angiogenesis and metastasis. AE is a potential adjunct therapeutic agent for treating resistant, mutant, heterogenous OC.",

The Working Group for this guideline designated pfs, which is associated with symptom control, as a critical outcome. A finding of net benefit can therefore be concluded based on significant differences in pfs. However, that benefit is not without identified harms. Given the identified harms, patient involvement in the decision-making process must take into consideration the side effect profiles of olaparib and bevacizumab within the context of improved pfs but minimal change in os.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the third most common gynecologic malignancy worldwide but accounts for the highest mortality rate among these cancers. A stepwise approach to assessment, diagnosis, and treatment is vital to appropriate management of this disease process. An integrated approach with gynecologic oncologists as well as medical oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists is of paramount importance to improving outcomes. Surgical cytoreduction to R0 is the mainstay of treatment, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Genetic testing for gene mutations that affect treatment is the standard of care for all women with epithelial ovarian cancer. Nearly all women will have a recurrence, and the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer continues to be nuanced and requires extensive review of up to date modalities that balance efficacy with the patient's quality of life. Maintenance therapy with poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors, bevacizumab, and/or drugs targeting homologous recombination deficiency is becoming more widely used in the treatment of ovarian cancer, and the advancement of immunotherapy is further revolutionizing treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "Herein, we describe our experience with a recurrent ovarian cancer patient who was treated safely with bevacizumab and who achieved a complete response despite receiving nine prior chemotherapy regimens. The patient was a 54-year-old woman with stage IIIC recurrent ovarian serous adenocarcinoma (grade 3). Computed tomography (CT) revealed that no evidence of ascites, multiple intraperitoneal dissemination, or intrapelvic lymph node metastases was present. The absence of bowel obstruction and disseminated lesions involving the intestinal tract was confirmed by CT. Performance status was 0, and a blood test also indicated preservation of major organ function. In our hospital, weekly paclitaxel plus bevacizumab therapy (paclitaxel at 80 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, and 15; bevacizumab at 15/mg/kg on day 1 and every 21 days thereafter) was started. Eight cycles were administered, with no signs of gastrointestinal perforation, and the antitumor effect was evaluated as a complete response. The observed adverse events included grade 1 hyponatremia and grade 1 hypochloremia, and there was one grade 1 sensory peripheral neuropathy. These adverse events neither delayed treatment nor necessitated any dosage reductions. This case suggests that bevacizumab can be safely administered even to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who have received three or more prior chemotherapy regimens if there are neither symptoms of bowel obstruction nor lesions suggestive of intestinal invasion on diagnostic imaging.",

    "title": "The current role of secondary cytoreductive surgery for recurrent ovarian cancer.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer represents worldwide the second most frequent and the most fatal gynecological malignancy, with approximately two thirds of the patients presenting with advanced disease. Cytoreductive surgery, primary or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients. Despite the improvement in quality of cytoreductive surgery as well as development of novel drugs and chemotherapy regimens, still most women with ovarian cancer will ultimately develop recurrent disease and die of their disease. In contrast to the management of primary disease, the standard treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer remains a topic of debate. While platinum-based or second line systemic chemotherapy, depending on the time after last platinum treatment, is standard of care, the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery has been a controversial issue for the last decades. Potential outcome benefit must be also weighed against the risk of severe surgical morbidity, impairment of quality of life and costs. In platinum-resistant recurrent disease, i.e., relapse after less than 6 months from the last platinum-based chemotherapy for primary disease, secondary cytoreduction seems generally not to be indicated due to its aggressive biological behavior and the absence of effective systemic treatment. In this comprehensive review, the current role of cytoreductive surgery in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer is discussed thoroughly in view of the results of most recent randomized trials and a meta-analysis. There seems to be definitely a role for secondary cytoreductive surgery in selected patients with ovarian cancer recurrence in whom complete resection of macroscopic disease is feasible. However, its role should be continuously reviewed due to the changing systemic treatment of patients with ovarian cancer recurrence over time.",

    "abstract": "So far, ovarian cancer has still been the most lethal gynecological malignancy. The chemotherapy and targeted medication are the mainstay for the recurrent ovarian cancer treatment. About 70% of the advanced-stage cases will relapse. Ascites-derived organoid is a pre-clinical model for the precise prediction of the therapeutic effectiveness for the ovarian cancer: it can be used to assess the drug sensitivity, to guide individualized precise treatment, and to improve advanced stage as well as recurrent ovarian cancer patient' survival and prognosis. Until now, there has been no report concerning the establishment of the organoid out of the patient's ascites and the concurrent usage of drug sensitivity test to guide the individualized precise treatment for the ovarian cancer. Here, we report a case of recurrent ovarian cancer of a 59-year-old female patient whose CA125 at its peak increased to 4523.4 U/mL. Then, patient's own ovarian cancer organoid was constructed from the ascites by the abdominocentesis; concurrently, medication sensitivity test was performed on the organoid to guide individualized precise treatment. After the treatment, CA125 decreased to 33.7 U/mL, and the patient's condition relieved effectively. This is the first published case report using ascites-derived organoid and the drug sensitivity test thereof to guide the precise treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Most patients with ovarian cancer experience recurrence and develop resistance to platinum-based agents. The diagnosis of platinum resistance based on the platinum-free interval is not always accurate and timely in clinical settings. Herein, we used laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to visualize the platinum distribution in the ovarian cancer tissues at the time of interval debulking surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 27patients with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Two distinct patterns of platinum distribution were observed. Type A (n = 16): platinum accumulation at the adjacent stroma but little in the tumor; type B (n = 11): even distribution of platinum throughout the tumor and adjacent stroma. The type A patients treated post-surgery with platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy showed significantly shorter periods of recurrence after the last platinum-based chemotherapy session (p = 0.020) and were diagnosed with \"platinum-resistant recurrence\". Moreover, type A was significantly correlated with worse prognosis (p = 0.031). Post-surgery treatment with non-platinum-based chemotherapy could be effective for the patients classified as type A. Our findings indicate that the platinum resistance can be predicted prior to recurrence, based on the platinum distribution; this could contribute to the selection of more appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, which may lead to improves prognoses.",

    "title": "Successful secondary radical operation on unretractable metastatic platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer by immunotherapy: a case report.",
    "abstract": "Although rechallenge with platinum-based chemotherapy is effective for most platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) patients, there is still a subset of patients who have no responses to the standard care. Overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) is a top priority in oncology clinics, but it remains intricate. It is difficult for clinicians to manage unretractable ROC when conventional therapy yields no results. The rational and effective use of immunotherapy will contribute to the clinical benefit of these patients, especially in patients without approved immunotherapy biomarkers. Here we present a case of successful secondary radical surgery for unretractable metastatic MDR ROC by immunotherapy based on her immune-infiltrating tumor microenvironment signatures.\n          \nA 57-year-old woman, diagnosed with IC2 stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer in 2015, underwent immediate ultra-radical cytoreductive surgery followed by 6 cycles of platinum-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. After nearly 37 months of disease-free status, the woman complained of spontaneous pain from the right subcostal margin for 1 month and was diagnosed with ROC accompanied by multiple unretractable colorectal and hepatic metastases. Standard chemotherapies were ineffective and quickly resulted in disease progression and grade IV myelosuppression followed impaired gastrointestinal function. Notably, after standard chemotherapy, the patient was tested negative for all immune biomarkers, but multiple fluorescence immunohistochemistry indicated that her tumor tissue was significantly infiltrated with the cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, implying potential benefits of immunotherapy. Then changed to 3 cycles of intravenous pembrolizumab, the main pelvic tumor and hepatic metastases showed significant shrinkage and achieved partial response, but the disease progressed after 8.7 months. Subsequently, arterial perfusion with pembrolizumab was performed combined with the chemotherapy. A comfortingly partial response was achieved again that enabled the patient to successfully undergo a secondary radical surgery for colorectal and liver metastases. Since that time the patient's postoperative course has been favorable, and she remains disease-free at present for at least 17 months.\n          \nImmune infiltration signatures of the tumor microenvironment could serve as an indication for immunotherapy in patients with unretractable platinum-sensitive ROC with MDR. In addition, the introduction of immunotherapy might bring some degree of chemotherapy resensitization.",

    "title": "Update on the secondary cytoreduction in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer: a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "The ovarian cancer recurrence occurs in 75% of patients with advanced FIGO stage, and its treatment is a challenge for the oncologist in gynecology. The standard treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) usually includes intravenous chemotherapy according to platinum sensitivity. Furthermore, maintenance treatment with target therapies [e.g., anti-angiogenic drug or PARP inhibitors (PARPi)], should be provided if not precedently administrated. In this scenario, secondary cytoreductive surgery (SCS) remains a practical but controversial option for platinum-sensitive ROC (PSROC). So far, several retrospective series and a Cochrane meta-analysis had concluded that SCS could determine better survival outcomes in ROC with favorable prognostic characteristics, such as the presence of a single anatomical site of recurrence, or when patients are accurately selected for surgery based on complete resection's predictive models. Recently, three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) investigated the role of SCS in PSROC patients selected with different criteria. All the three RCTs showed a significant statistical advantage in progression-free survival (PFS) in the SCS group, with an even more significant difference in patients with complete cytoreduction (about 7-month PFS increased). Data on overall survival (OS) are different in the two completed trials. The GOG213 study has documented a longer OS of PSROC patients who received chemotherapy alone compared to surgery plus chemotherapy. Contrarily, the DESKTOP III trial showed 7.7 months of increased OS in the surgery group vs. chemotherapy alone, with a more difference in the complete tumor cytoreduction (CTC) group (12 months). These RCTs thereby suggest that undergoing complete cytoreduction may not be the only key and that the disease biology may also matter. Few recent retrospective series investigated the role of SCS according to BRCA mutation status and the effect of SCS in patients receiving emerging PARPi. A consequence of the developments in SCS and knowledge of different molecular pathways influencing the recurrent disease is that the future research objective should be to individualize and personalize the surgical approach.",

    "abstract": "High-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) with BRCA1/2 mutations exhibit improved outcome and sensitivity to double-strand DNA break (DSB)-inducing agents (i.e., platinum and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors [PARPis]) due to an underlying defect in homologous recombination (HR). However, resistance to platinum and PARPis represents a significant barrier to the long-term survival of these patients. Although BRCA1/2-reversion mutations are a clinically validated resistance mechanism, they account for less than half of platinum-resistant BRCA1/2-mutated HGSOCs. We uncover a resistance mechanism by which a microRNA, miR-622, induces resistance to PARPis and platinum in BRCA1 mutant HGSOCs by targeting the Ku complex and restoring HR-mediated DSB repair. Physiologically, miR-622 inversely correlates with Ku expression during the cell cycle, suppressing non-homologous end-joining and facilitating HR-mediated DSB repair in S phase. Importantly, high expression of miR-622 in BRCA1-deficient HGSOCs is associated with worse outcome after platinum chemotherapy, indicating microRNA-mediated resistance through HR rescue.",

Here we report the activity of CHK1i in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with measurable and biopsiable disease (cohort 5), or without biopsiable disease (cohort 6). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes were safety and progression-free survival (PFS). 49 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled (24 in cohort 5, 25 in cohort 6). Among the 39 RECISTv1.1-evaluable patients, ORR was 33.3% in cohort 5 and 28.6% in cohort 6. Primary endpoint was not evaluable due to early stop of the trial. The median PFS was 4 months in cohort 5 and 6 months in cohort 6. Toxicity was manageable. Translational research was an exploratory endpoint. Potential biomarkers were investigated using pre-treatment fresh biopsies and serial blood samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed high levels of DNA replication-related genes (POLA1, POLE, GINS3) associated with lack of clinical benefit [defined post-hoc as PFS < 6 months]. Subsequent preclinical experiments demonstrated significant cytotoxicity of POLA1 silencing in combination with CHK1i in platinum-resistant HGSOC cell line models. Therefore, POLA1 expression may be predictive for CHK1i resistance, and the concurrent POLA1 inhibition may improve the efficacy of CHK1i monotherapy in this hard-to-treat population, deserving further investigation.",

Presented here is the case of an adult patient with NSCNEC of the ovaries associated with a deleterious BRCA2 germline mutation.

We conducted a retrospective review of thirty-one unrelated patients found to be heterozygous for a germline pathogenic variant in ATM and identified a significant proportion of patients in this cohort with cancers not currently associated with the ATM hereditary cancer syndrome, including carcinomas of the gallbladder, uterus, duodenum, kidney, and lung as well as a vascular sarcoma. A comprehensive review of the literature found 25 relevant studies where 171 individuals with a germline deleterious ATM variant have been diagnosed with the same or similar cancers. The combined data from these studies were then used to estimate the prevalence of germline ATM pathogenic variants in these cancers, which ranged between 0.45% and 2.2%. Analysis of tumor sequencing performed in large cohorts demonstrated that the frequency of deleterious somatic ATM alterations in these atypical cancers equaled or exceeded the alteration frequency in breast cancer and occurred at a significantly higher rate than in other DNA-damage response tumor suppressors, namely BRCA1 and CHEK2. Furthermore, multi-gene analysis of somatic alterations in these atypical cancers demonstrated significant co-occurrence of pathogenic alterations in ATM with BRCA1 and CHEK2, while there was significant mutual exclusivity between pathogenic alterations in ATM and TP53. This indicates that germline ATM pathogenic variants may play a role in cancer initiation and progression in these atypical ATM malignancies, potentially influencing these cancers to be driven toward DNA-damage repair deficiency and away from loss of TP53. As such, these findings provide evidence for broadening of the ATM-cancer susceptibility syndrome phenotype to improve the recognition of affected patients and provide more efficacious, germline-directed therapies.",

    "abstract": "Given the rarity of RAD51C mutations, the risk and treatment of metachronous breast cancer after the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in RAD51C mutation carriers is not clear, especially for those who have received PARPi treatment. We report the case of a 65-year-old woman diagnosed with stage IIIC high-grade serous primary fallopian tube cancer. The patient had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The patient received three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin and achieved a complete response. After interval debulking surgery, the patient received three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Collection and extraction of saliva DNA for next-generation sequencing identified a RAD51C mutation c.838-2 A > G. The patient received niraparib as front-line maintenance treatment. After 36 months of niraparib treatment, the patient had grade II invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast that was positive for estrogen receptor (90%) and Ki-67 (30%) and negative for progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. Computed tomography revealed the absence of distant metastases. Modified radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were then performed. The final pathological report of the breast showed a 1.8 cm Bloom-Richardson grade II invasive ductal carcinoma in the left breast with axillary lymph node metastasis (1/21). Finally, the breast cancer was stage IIA, pT1cN1M0. The metachronous breast cancer in this case may be the first report of second primary cancer in fallopian tube cancer patient harboring a RAD51C mutation during niraparib treatment. Further studies are required to determine optimal treatment.",

RAD51C is a less commonly studied ovarian cancer susceptibility gene whose promoter is sometimes methylated, leading to homologous recombination (HR) deficiency and PARPi sensitivity. For this study, the PARPi-sensitive patient-derived ovarian cancer xenograft PH039, which lacks HR gene mutations but harbors RAD51C promoter methylation, was selected for PARPi resistance by cyclical niraparib treatment in vivo. PH039 acquired PARPi resistance by the third treatment cycle and grew through subsequent treatment with either niraparib or rucaparib. Transcriptional profiling throughout the course of resistance development showed widespread pathway level changes along with a marked increase in RAD51C mRNA, which reflected loss of RAD51C promoter methylation. Analysis of ovarian cancer samples from the ARIEL2 Part 1 clinical trial of rucaparib monotherapy likewise indicated an association between loss of RAD51C methylation prior to on-study biopsy and limited response. Interestingly, the PARPi resistant PH039 model remained platinum sensitive. Collectively, these results not only indicate that PARPi treatment pressure can reverse RAD51C methylation and restore RAD51C expression, but also provide a model for studying the clinical observation that PARPi and platinum sensitivity are sometimes dissociated.",

    "abstract": "While poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have improved the prognosis of ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) tumors that are homologous recombination (HR) deficient (HRD), new therapeutic strategies are needed for tumors that are HR proficient (HRP) because they demonstrate greater resistance to current treatments and thus have poorer clinical outcomes. Additionally, clinical precautionary statements regarding potential risks associated with PARPi, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, highlight the need for combinatorial approaches that can lessen the dose and duration of PARPi treatment to reduce toxicities. Here, we evaluated DNA double-strand damage repair pathways in HRD and HRP ovarian cancer cell lines and found that in HRD cell lines, PARPi therapy reduced non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated repair, specifically due to decreased theta-mediated end-joining. The combination of PARPi with ATM serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (ATMi) suppressed both NHEJ and HR pathways in HRD and HRP cell lines, with synergistic increases in apoptosis and decreases in cell viability and colony formation. Interestingly, PARPi plus ATMi also decreased NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, which was not observed when PARPi was combined with inhibition of the ATR kinase (ATRi). These findings indicate that PARPi plus ATMi is a promising strategy for HGSC independent of underlying tumor HR status.",

    "abstract": "While therapies targeting deficiencies in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway are emerging as the standard treatment for high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) patients, this strategy is limited to the ~50% of patients with a deficiency in this pathway. Therefore, patients with HR-proficient tumors are likely to be resistant to these therapies and require alternative strategies. We found that the HR gene Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) is wildtype and its activity is upregulated in HGSOC compared to normal fallopian tube tissue. Interestingly, multiple pathways related to metabolism are inversely correlated with ATM expression in HGSOC specimens, suggesting that combining ATM inhibition with metabolic drugs would be effective. Analysis of FDA-approved drugs from the Dependency Map demonstrated that ATM-low cells are more sensitive to fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist that affects multiple cellular metabolic pathways. Consistently, PPARα signaling is associated with ATM expression. We validated that combined inhibition of ATM and treatment with fenofibrate is synergistic in multiple HGSOC cell lines by inducing senescence. Together, our results suggest that metabolic changes induced by ATM inhibitors are a potential target for the treatment of HGSOC.",

    "abstract": "Poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) has become an important maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer after surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapy, which has changed the disease management model of ovarian cancer, greatly decreased the risk of recurrence, and made the prognosis of ovarian cancer better to certain extent. The three PARPis currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of ovarian cancer are Olaparib, Niraparib and Rucaparib. With the incremental results from new clinical trials, the applicable population of PARPi for ovarian cancer have expanded to population with non-BRCA mutations. Although BRCA mutated population are still the main beneficiaries of PARPi, recent clinical trials indicated PARPis' therapeutic potential in non-BRCA mutated population, especially in homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) positive population. However, lack of unified HRD status detection method poses a challenge for the accurate selection of PARPi beneficiaries. The reversal of homologous recombination (HR) function during the treatment will not only cause resistance to PARPis, but also reduce the accuracy of the current method to determine HRD status. Therefore, the development of reliable HRD status detection methods to determine the beneficiary population, as well as rational combination treatment are warranted. This review mainly summarizes the latest clinical trial results and combination treatment of PARPis in ovarian cancer with non-BRCA mutations, and discusses the application prospects, including optimizing combination therapy against drug resistance, developing unified and accurate HRD status detection methods for patient selection and stratification. This review further poses an interesting topic: the efficacy and safety in patients retreated with PARPis after previous PARPi treatment---\"PARPi after PARPi\".",

Evidence from clinical trials to date has demonstrated that patients with a BRCAm derive the greatest benefit from PARP inhibitors. However, clinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors provide benefit to women with ovarian cancer who do not have a BRCAm. The recent updated approvals of olaparib, niraparib and rucaparib by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of all platinum-sensitive relapsed (PSR) ovarian-cancer populations, regardless of their BRCAm status, support this. Long-term tolerability and efficacy of olaparib have been demonstrated in patients both with and without a BRCAm, with 13% of patients receiving maintenance olaparib for at least 5 years in one study, which is unprecedented in the relapsed ovarian-cancer setting (versus 1% on placebo). Further studies should be performed to elucidate which non-BRCAm patients are deriving benefit and what molecular processes are enabling this, so that patients continue to receive optimal treatment for their disease. Here, we review clinical and molecular markers of HRD, the long-term clinical safety and efficacy of PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer, with a focus on olaparib and the current approved indications for PARP inhibitors, as well as guidance on treatment decisions for patients with PSR ovarian cancer.",

No evidence is available so far on the effectiveness of poly ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) in this population. Here, we report a 60-year-old female patient diagnosed with left ureter high-grade UC. Recurrent lesions were found 20 months after radical surgery. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed a slightly high-density soft tissue mass (3.2 × 3.1 cm) on the left posterior wall of the abdomen (waist), soft tissue mass adjacent to the left inner wall of the pelvis (3.2 × 4.2 cm), and multiple enlarged lymph nodes to the left of abdominal aorta. A next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based 605-gene panel detected a novel BRCA2 pathogenic germline mutation c.1670T>A (p.L557*), and a series of somatic insertion and deletion (INDEL) mutations of BRCA1, RB1, and JAK2, and single nucleotide variation (SNV) mutations of TP53, KMT2D, MET, ROS1, and IL7R.

In conclusion, this study proved for the first time that PARPi was effective for UC treatment in patients carrying germline BRCA2 pathogenic mutations, providing new treatment options for such patients. In addition, the circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) test can be used for drug selection and response monitoring in UC treatment.",

    "title": "Synchronous ovarian metastasis from colorectal cancer: A report of two cases.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian metastasis of colorectal cancer is relatively rare. The present study reports two cases of synchronous ovarian metastasis from colorectal cancer, which were managed by cytoreductive surgery. In case one, a 60-year-old female patient presented with a multilocular pelvic tumor and ascites. Virtual colonoscopy revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon; however, no tumor cells were identified on histological examination. Ovarian metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer was suspected and adnexectomy was subsequently performed. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of the resected tumor revealed positive staining for cytokeratin (CK)20 and caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX2), and negative staining for CK7, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and inhibin. The immunohistological results supported the diagnosis of ovarian metastasis from sigmoid colon cancer. In case two, a 56-year-old female patient presented with a multilocular pelvic tumor and ascites. Colonoscopy identified a rectal tumor, and histological examination revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by cytological analysis of ascites. Subsequently, ovarian metastasis from rectal cancer with peritoneal dissemination was diagnosed, and left ovariectomy and transverse colostomy were performed. Histological examination of the excised tumor revealed moderately-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and immunohistochemical investigation revealed positive staining for CK20 and CDX2, but negative staining for CK7. These immunohistological results indicated ovarian metastasis from rectal cancer. Both patients recovered well and are currently undergoing regular follow-up examinations. The observations from the two cases indicate that ovarian metastases of primary colorectal cancer may present as pelvic tumors and, thus, preoperative examination of the gastrointestinal tract is required. Furthermore, even in cases of widespread colorectal cancer metastases, excision of the ovarian tumor is required to establish a histological diagnosis for the selection of appropriate treatments.",

    "title": "High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and detection of inactivated BRCA genes from biopsy material of Slovak patients.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of mortality among all gynecological cancers in developed countries and its most common and most lethal type is the high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). At the molecular level, nearly half of all HGSCs exhibit ineffective homologous DNA recombination and disruption of DNA damage/repair pathway inactivation caused often by BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutation. Recently, the detection of BRCA1/2 mutations became important for personalized treatment of HGSC patients with the PARP-inhibitors in the defined clinical setting of relapse after positive adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapeutic response. Based on the selection of patients by regional oncologists, we attempted to verify the possibilities of BRCA1/2 mutation testing on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy material from regional hospitals. In the study we used: a/ FFPE tumor resections of 97 patients sent to our laboratory, originally stored in archives of regional departments for a period of 1-3 years and retrieved on the principle to contain a maximum of non-necrotic tumor tissue, b/ next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay covering all known mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes on MiSeq (Illumina® platform), and c/ Sophia DDM® bioinformatics platform. After processing of FFPE samples, 5 cases were excluded due to the insufficient genomic DNA quantity. Bioinformatics results of NGS analyses of 92 patients' samples indicated 17.39% pathogenic mutations and 32.61% potentially pathogenic mutations in genes BRCA1/2. Overall, 50% pathogenic and potentially pathogenic mutations were detected in the patient's cohort. The relatively high incidence of BRCA1/2 mutations in our series may be influenced by various indicators including the selection of patients based on adjuvant therapy response as well as regional or population heterogeneity in their frequency. Based on the interdisciplinary cooperation, the use of archival biopsy material processed primarily and stored for a longer period in different laboratories without uniformly defined pre-analytical conditions allows identifying the HGSC patients who might better respond to the PARP-inhibition therapy.",

    "abstract": "We present the case of a 51-year-old woman with a history of invasive lobular breast adenocarcinoma in remission for six years following surgery, chemoradiotherapy, and hormone therapy. During follow-up, an asymptomatic elevation of CA 15-3 was detected. A CT scan revealed rectal wall thickening suggestive of neoplasia, with no other lesions observed. Colonoscopy demonstrated a congested, thickened, and infiltrative mucosa in the rectal ampulla extending from the internal anal margin, accompanied by an impassable stricture 8 cm from the anal margin. Initial endoscopic biopsies were negative for malignancy. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed rectal wall thickening, loss of normal wall stratification, and a regular outer border, findings consistent with rectal linitis plastica. The stricture prevented further advancement of the echoendoscope, but fine-needle biopsies were performed. Histological analysis confirmed adenocarcinoma infiltration of breast origin.",

Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed a metastasis of high-grade serous carcinoma, likely of gynecological origin. A PET-CT scan identified a tumor in the left adnexa, with no other organ involvement. The patient underwent primary cytoreduction, including laparoscopy, hysterosalpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and resection of the right deep inguinal lymph nodes at the Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology. No residual disease was found post-surgery. Pathological examination revealed high-grade serous cancer in the fimbria of the left fallopian tube and left ovary, while the right deep inguinal lymph nodes were negative. The patient received standard chemotherapy (Carboplatin and Taxol) and showed no new lesions after three cycles, as confirmed by imaging.",
