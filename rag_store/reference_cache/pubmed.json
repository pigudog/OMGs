    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a special pathological type of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and has a high prevalence in Asia without specific molecular subtype classification. Endometriosis is a recognized precancerous lesion that carries 3-fold increased risk of OCCC. Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, which also originates from endometriosis, shares several features with OCCC, including platinum resistance and younger age at diagnosis. Patients with OCCC have about a 2.5 to 4 times greater risk of having a venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with other EOC, and OCCC tends to metastasize through lymphatic vesicular and peritoneal spread as opposed to hematogenous metastasis. There is only mild elevation of the conventional biomarker CA125. Staging surgery or optimal cytoreduction combined with chemotherapy is a common therapeutic strategy for OCCC. However, platinum resistance commonly portends a poor prognosis, so novel treatments are urgently needed. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are currently being studied, including PARP, EZH2, and ATR inhibitors combined with the synthetic lethality of ARID1A-dificiency, and MAPK/PI3K/HER2, VEGF/bFGF/PDGF, HNF1β, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Advanced stage, suboptimal cytoreduction, platinum resistance, lymph node metastasis, and VTE are major prognostic predictors for OCCC. We focus on update pathogenesis, diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches to provide future directions for clinical diagnosis and treatment of OCCC.",

    "title": "Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma: An Endometriosis-Associated Cancer with Therapeutic Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer with distinct pathological features, molecular profiles, and biological functions. OCCC has high incidence rates in East Asia compared to the Western hemisphere and Europe and is associated with endometriosis. With its relative resistance to conventional treatment regimens and the worst stage-adjusted prognosis among ovarian cancer subtypes, there is an urgent need to optimize therapeutic options and to improve patient outcomes. To achieve this goal, better patient stratification strategies are required. These strategies could derive from comprehensive and in-depth multidimensional analysis of tumor heterogeneity. Understanding intertumor heterogeneity could assist us in stratifying OCCC patients based on features that are prognostic or predictive. Recent genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiling analyses allow us to provide an integrative perspective on the diverse heterogeneity in OCCC that could pave the way for novel translational research and clinical development in the future.",

    "title": "Prognostic value of preoperative lymphocyte-monocyte ratio in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the prognostic significances of markers of preoperative systemic inflammatory response (SIR) in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC). Methods: A total of 109 patients diagnosed with OCCC that underwent primary cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy from 2009 to 2012 were enrolled in this retrospective study. SIR markers were calculated from complete blood cell counts determined before surgery. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine optimal cut-off values for neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Prognostic significances with respect to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined by Kaplan-Meier curve and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results: The optimized NLR, LMR and PLR cut-off values as determined by ROC curve analysis for PFS and OS were 2.3, 4.2, and 123.6, respectively. When the cohort was divided using these optimized cut-offs, NLR and LMR were found to be significantly associated with clinicopathologic factors, NLR with FIGO stage, the presence of malignant ascites, and platinum response, and LMR with FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, malignant ascites, and platinum response. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a high NLR (> 2.3) was significantly associated with low 5-year PFS and OS rates and that a high LMR was significantly associated with high 5-year PFS and OS rates. Multivariate analysis identified FIGO stage, residual mass, and platinum response as independent prognostic factors of PFS, and FIGO stage, residual mass, platinum response, and LMR as independent prognostic factors of OS. Conclusions: Markers of systemic inflammatory response provide useful prognostic information and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio is the most reliable independent prognostic factor of overall survival in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.",

    "title": "Case Series and a Literature Review: Two Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma Cases with Recurrent Endometriosis.",
    "abstract": "Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) is rare, occurring approximately in 1% of women with ovarian endometriosis. The main histological types are endometrioid adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), with the latter being the least common.\n          \nIn our hospital, we recently summarized two patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma with similar characteristics. They all had endometriosis for a long time and had undergone ovarian cyst removal due to a chocolate cyst. Unfortunately, the cyst recurred after surgery, and the histological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. In case 1, the expression of P53 was found in the tumor by regular examination, and the stage was IIB. In Case 2, we found it in intraoperative freezing; the stage was IA. Case 1 has been treated with the TP regimen six times, and the survival period has reached one year. Case 2 had a survival period of 6 years after completing six TP regimen treatments. Clinicians should pay attention to patients with a long history of endometriosis and postoperative recurrence of ovarian cysts accompanied by serum CA-125 of more than 200U/mL. Imaging examination has a good prospect in diagnosing malignant transformation of endometriosis, especially PET-CT.\n          \nThis case report highlights the risk factors related to the formation of ovarian clear cell carcinoma and suggests that the follow-up of patients with ovarian endometriosis is essential because of its recurrence characteristics. Radical surgery and postoperative platinum-containing chemotherapy are the primary treatment methods at present.",
