    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a special pathological type of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and has a high prevalence in Asia without specific molecular subtype classification. Endometriosis is a recognized precancerous lesion that carries 3-fold increased risk of OCCC. Ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, which also originates from endometriosis, shares several features with OCCC, including platinum resistance and younger age at diagnosis. Patients with OCCC have about a 2.5 to 4 times greater risk of having a venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with other EOC, and OCCC tends to metastasize through lymphatic vesicular and peritoneal spread as opposed to hematogenous metastasis. There is only mild elevation of the conventional biomarker CA125. Staging surgery or optimal cytoreduction combined with chemotherapy is a common therapeutic strategy for OCCC. However, platinum resistance commonly portends a poor prognosis, so novel treatments are urgently needed. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are currently being studied, including PARP, EZH2, and ATR inhibitors combined with the synthetic lethality of ARID1A-dificiency, and MAPK/PI3K/HER2, VEGF/bFGF/PDGF, HNF1β, and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Advanced stage, suboptimal cytoreduction, platinum resistance, lymph node metastasis, and VTE are major prognostic predictors for OCCC. We focus on update pathogenesis, diagnostic methods and therapeutic approaches to provide future directions for clinical diagnosis and treatment of OCCC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis, and most patients experience recurrence after primary treatment. Currently, there is no standard treatment option for recurrent OCCC. Herein, we report the case of a 32-year-old female patient with OCCC. The patient received primary cytoreductive surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and remained disease-free for four months. She then experienced retroperitoneal lymph node recurrence and was treated with liposomal doxorubicin chemotherapy followed by secondary debulking surgery. The patient experienced a second relapse in the lower left lung 11 months later. Genomic profiling of tumor samples revealed a deleterious AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) mutation and homologous recombination deficiency. Thus, the triplet combination of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib; the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab; and the antiangiogenic agent, bevacizumab was administered. The patient achieved partial response, which was sustained for 12 months. Our study provides the first clinical evidence that the combination of olaparib with pembrolizumab and bevacizumab could be an effective treatment for patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent OCCC.",

    "abstract": "NUCOLL43 is a novel ovarian clear cell carcinoma (O-CCC) cell line that arose from a primary culture of a patient's malignant ascites. The cells grow reliably in cell culture with a doubling time of approx. 45 hours and form colonies at high efficiency. They have a very high degree of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting approximately 85% of the genome, mostly copy neutral and almost identical to the original tumor. The cells express epithelial (pan-cytokeratin) and mesenchymal (vimentin) characteristics, CA125 and p16, like the original tumor. They also express ARID1A but not HNF-1β and, like the original tumor, and are negative for p53 expression, with no evidence of p53 function. NUCOLL43 cells express all other DNA damage response proteins investigated and have functional homologous recombination DNA repair. They are insensitive to cisplatin, the PARP inhibitor rucaparib, and MDM2 inhibitors but are sensitive to camptothecin, paclitaxel, and NVP-BEZ235. The NUCOLL43 cell line represents a distinct subtype of O-CCC that is p53 and HNF-1β null but expresses ARID1A. Its high degree of similarity with the original tumor genomically and proteomically, as well as the high level of LOH, make this an interesting cell line for O-CCC research.

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is a rare type of epithelial ovarian cancer characterized by a chemoresistant phenotype and high-grade tumor. Conventional therapies for OCCC include surgery and chemotherapy. However, these OCCC treatment approaches are characterized by a high risk of relapse and drug resistance resulting in poor prognosis. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches are required to achieve better outcomes. In this study, a PIK3CA p.R88Q mutation and PD-L1 expression with a tumor proportion score of 10% was explored in a patient who presented with rapid recurrence after surgery and unsuccessful postoperative chemotherapy. Based on the clinical condition and the patient preference, she was administered a novel combinatorial therapy comprising mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which is a well-known and potent inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and the anti-PD-1 antibody toripalimab. Treatment with this combinatorial therapy showed good prognosis, with more than eight months of disease control, and no severe adverse events were observed. The findings of this study provide a novel and effective strategy for OCCC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report a new combination regimen of immunotherapy (everolimus plus toripalimab) for solid tumors. Everolimus is not only an antitumor targeted drug but also an immunosuppressant; it's combination with immunotherapy is controversial. This is the first report to demonstrate that it has a synergistic effect.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) is rare, occurring approximately in 1% of women with ovarian endometriosis. The main histological types are endometrioid adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma (CCC), with the latter being the least common.\n          \nIn our hospital, we recently summarized two patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma with similar characteristics. They all had endometriosis for a long time and had undergone ovarian cyst removal due to a chocolate cyst. Unfortunately, the cyst recurred after surgery, and the histological diagnosis was clear cell carcinoma. In case 1, the expression of P53 was found in the tumor by regular examination, and the stage was IIB. In Case 2, we found it in intraoperative freezing; the stage was IA. Case 1 has been treated with the TP regimen six times, and the survival period has reached one year. Case 2 had a survival period of 6 years after completing six TP regimen treatments. Clinicians should pay attention to patients with a long history of endometriosis and postoperative recurrence of ovarian cysts accompanied by serum CA-125 of more than 200U/mL. Imaging examination has a good prospect in diagnosing malignant transformation of endometriosis, especially PET-CT.\n          \nThis case report highlights the risk factors related to the formation of ovarian clear cell carcinoma and suggests that the follow-up of patients with ovarian endometriosis is essential because of its recurrence characteristics.

Here, we present the case of a patient with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) who failed to respond to multiline chemotherapy and target therapy but achieved an immune complete response (iCR) with programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor treatment. The overall survival (OS) was 59 months, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 34 months after immunotherapy, which was counting. Meantime, molecular testing results revealed that traditional biomarkers for immunotherapy, including PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB), were negative. HLA-B44 (B*18:01) supertype was confirmed by sequence-based HLA typing. This case raises the possibility that ovarian cancer patients with multidrug resistance may still benefit from PD-1 inhibitor therapy, even if PD-L1 pathology is negative.",

    "abstract": "This retrospective cohort study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nedaplatin plus paclitaxel (NP) compared with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (CP) in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Patients with histologically proven epithelial ovarian cancer with recurrent interval ≥6 months after finishing platinum-based therapies between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2014 were investigated. Patients received an intravenous infusion of NP (nedaplatin 80 mg/m2 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) or CP (carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) protocols every 3 weeks for at least 6-8 cycles or until disease progression. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were toxicity and overall survival (OS). 436 patients were included in the study, containing 241 cases receiving CP regimen and 195 cases receiving NP regimen, who were all contained in safety analysis. Because of 61 patients with unbearable toxicity and poor compliance, 375 patients were finally included in the efficacy analysis. With median follow-up of 63.5 months, PFS was 11.0 months with NP regimen versus 9.5 months with CP regimen (P=0.109). Subgroup analysis indicated that PFS of the NP arm was statistically superior to the CP arm when recurrent interval was 6-12 months (P=0.048); median PFS was 10.0 versus 8.0 months, respectively. There was no significant difference in overall survival between two groups. More frequent grade 3-4 neutropenia (13.3% vs 33.6%), thrombocytopenia (5.6% vs 14.5%) and hypersensitivity reactions (5.6% vs 21.9% ) were observed in CP arm (P<0.01). Compared to the CP, NP regimen did not improve 5-year overall survival in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, but it had better tolerance. NP obtained significant benefit in progression-free survival when the recurrent interval was between 6 and 12 months, although the efficacy of two regimens were similar when the recurrent interval ≥12 months.",

Transcriptome analysis reveals upregulation of homologous recombination DNA repair and anti-apoptotic signals in this population. While treatment with carboplatin enriches for CA125-negative cells, co-treatment with carboplatin and birinapant eliminates these cells in HGSCs expressing high levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein cIAP in the CA125-negative population. Birinapant sensitizes CA125-negative cells to carboplatin by mediating degradation of cIAP causing cleavage of caspase 8 and restoration of apoptosis. This co-therapy significantly improves disease-free survival in vivo compared with either therapy alone in tumour-bearing mice. These findings suggest that therapeutic strategies that target CA125-negative cells may be useful in the treatment of HGSC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian clear cell carcinoma has a high recurrence rate with poor prognosis and is generally not sensitive to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy. Its less frequent occurrence of mutations such as BRCA limited the targeted therapies. Immunotherapy is not currently recommended as a first-line agent for ovarian cancer, and most patients are not yet able to benefit from it. Cryoablation can be used to treat solid systemic tumors, including ovarian cancer metastases, and can produce a limited anti-tumor immune response. The anti-tumor effects of cryoablation combined with immunotherapy have not been adequately confirmed. This study reports a case of a patient with ovarian clear cell carcinoma who underwent conventional adjuvant chemotherapy after initially surgical resection of the tumor. Unfortunately, cancer recurred and metastasized to the abdominal wall. After a series of painful chemotherapy and a second surgery, the cancer was still not effectively controlled, and the patient developed extensive metastases in the lung. The patient's PD-L1 expression level also did not support solo immunotherapy. We pioneered the use of cryoablation to first eradicate the most significant lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung and then combined it with the PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab to treat the patient with immunotherapy, which resulted in the complete eradication of the other multiple metastases in the lung and saved the patient's life. Although the precise mechanism of action has not yet been explored, we have reason to believe that the combination of cryoablation and immune checkpoint inhibitor has a powerful synergistic anti-tumor effect, which is yet to be confirmed by more basic research and clinical applications in the next step.",
